Technical-Abstracting Fundamentals.
II. Writing Principles and Practices
  Abstracts can serve their purpose best only if they are
carefully written to transmit important information to
readers quickly and accurately.  This requires knowledge
of audience needs, habits, and desires; ability to identify
the key facts in the document; ability to organize these
facts, to present them in the order best suited to the
audience; and ability to write the abstracts clearly,
concisely, and in conformity with the style rules of the
medium involved.  Some of these abilities are inborn, but
all can be learned by study, practice, and criticism.
