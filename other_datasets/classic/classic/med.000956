congenital hydronephrosis.
histological study of the renal parenchyma
in cases of hydronephrosis is a guide for
surgical treatment.  if the renal parenchyma
is reduced in thickness to 3 mm. or less
it leads to complete atrophy.  but if the
thickness is more than 3 mm. conservative
procedures are justified.
