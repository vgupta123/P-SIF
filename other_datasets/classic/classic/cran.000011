similar solutions in compressible laminar free mixing
problems .
there are in supersonic aerodynamics many situations of
practical interest wherein streams of different velocities and,
in general, different stagnation pressures mix with one another .
in the majority of these problems the interaction between the
two streams takes place in the presence of an axial pressure
gradient .  its effect on the characteristics of the mixing may
influence significantly the performances of the devices wherein
the phenomena cited above occur .  a theoretical and
experimental program of research to study mixing in the presence of
axial pressure gradients is being carried on at the polytechnic
institute of brooklyn .
