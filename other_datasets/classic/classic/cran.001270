supersonic inlet dynamics .
  an approximation of the differential equation for compressible
duct flow is presented .  the equation is linear and of the second
order .  the duct transfer function and response characteristics
are obtained by applying small-perturbation theory to the
differential equation .  the resulting equations describe duct
natural frequency as a function of duct areas and volumes, and
damping ratio as a function of the slope of the steady-state mass
flow, pressure-recovery curve .
  the calcualted response agrees, to a first approximation, with
measured response as obtained from tests of a fixed-geometry,
sugar-scoop inlet model with hypass for matching airflows .
testing was done in the 10 x 10 and 8 x 6 ft. supersonic tunnels
at nasa lewis flight propulsion laboratory .  further
agreement was obtained during flight tests of the f8u-3 airplane .
