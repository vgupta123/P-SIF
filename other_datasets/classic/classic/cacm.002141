Algorithmic Selection of the Best
Method for Compressing Map Data Strings
The best of a dozen different methods for
compressing map data is illustrated.  The choices 
are generated by encoding data strings-sequence of like
codes-by three methods and in four directions. 
 Relationships are developed between compression alternatives
to avoid comparing all of them.  The technique 
has been used to compress data from forest resource maps,
but is widely applicable to map and photographic 
data reduction.
