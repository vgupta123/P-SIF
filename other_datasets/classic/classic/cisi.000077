The Effectiveness of Automatically Generated Weights and 
 Links in Mechanical Indexing
   Work concerned with the statistical evaluation of the output of the MEDICO 
automatic indexing method is described.. The statistical test were designed
primarily to examine the validity of the assumptions which formed the basis of 
the algorithms developed for the automatic computation of weights and for the 
automatic generation of links between index terms and modifiers.. This 
evaluation also includes a comparison of the output generated from full text 
and from the processing of the abstracts or summaries of the same articles..
