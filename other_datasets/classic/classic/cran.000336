simplified laminar boundary layer calculations for
bodies of revolution and for yawed wings .
  since the introduction of momentum methods in
boundary-layer calculations by von karman and pohlhausen, many
improvements have been proposed .  an especially simple solution
reduces the problem to a quadrature .  here, it is proposed to
extend these methods to elementary three-dimensional cases and to
compressible laminar boundary-layer calculations .  for
comparison, the corresponding problems for the turbulent boundary
layer are also discussed briefly .
