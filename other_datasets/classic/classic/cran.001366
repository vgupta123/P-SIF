the compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer
and arbitrary pressure gradient .
  an approximate method for the calculation of the
compressible laminar boundary layer with heat transfer and
arbitrary pressure gradient, based on thwaites' correlation
concept, is presented .  the method results from the application
of stewartson's transformation to prandtl's equations, which
yeilds a nonlinear set of two first-order differential equations .
these equations are then expressed in terms of dimensionless
parameters related to the wall shear, the surface heat transfer,
and the transformed free-stream velocity .  thwaites' concept
of the unique interdependence of these parameters is assumed .
the evaluation of these quantities is then carried out by utilizing
exact solutions recently obtained .
  with the resulting relations, methods are derived for the
calculation of the two-dimensional and axially symmetric
laminar boundary layer with arbitrary free-stream velocity
distribution .  mach number, and surface temperature level .
  the combined effect of heat transfer and pressure gradient
is demonstrated by applying the method to calculate the
characteristics of the boundary layer on thin supersonic surfaces
and in a highly cooled, convergent-divergent, axially symmetric
rocket nozzle .
