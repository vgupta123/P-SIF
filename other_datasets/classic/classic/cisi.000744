Semiconductor Journals
   Using an on-line literature searching system, the number of papers in many 
journals dealing with semiconductors was determined.. The journals are ranked 
by the percentage of their contents devoted to semiconductors, and by the total
number of semiconductors papers are published.. Only four journals devote over
half of their contents to semiconductors papers.. Approximately half of the
19,646 papers (which were found in 91 journals) appeared in eight journals..
