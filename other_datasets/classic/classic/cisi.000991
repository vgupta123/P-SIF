Congress to ease the tasks of filers and users and to pave the way for
computer-assisted filing.. This article discusses preliminary considerations

the interaction between users and catalogs, and ways to simplify arrangements..
The assumptions and principles that underlie the proposed rules are stated, and 
their organization and anticipated use are described.. An abridged version of 
the rules is illustrated by an extended example..
