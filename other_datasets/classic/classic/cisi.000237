Book Selection of Censorship
  The key question was whether restrictions are being imposed on
librarians, or whether they are imposing restrictions on themselves, that
threaten the citizen's right to easy access to as adequate a collection of
books and periodicals as his community, his country or his state can
afford.  Readers of this report may come to different conclusions about
the "right" answer to this question, but whether they conclude that
librarians are or are not being as forceful as they might be in developing
and upholding freedom-to-read principles, it should not be forgotten
that it is librarians themselves who have had the courage to provide the
evidence.
