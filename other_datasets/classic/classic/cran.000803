the shock pattern of a wing-body combination far from
the flight path .
  the position and strength of the front shock wave at large
distances from a wing-body combination, are deduced from the linear
theory for the combination, using a method developed by whitham .  the
combination consists of a body of revolution and a wing which has
thickness and is lifting .  the effects of interference between the flow
over the body and the flow over the wing are included .  in any
direction the flow far from the wing-body combination is equivalent to
the flow past a body of revolution determined from the configuration of
the combination .  the modified formulae for unsteady flow are given and
some results are evaluated for the combination of a body of revolution
and a delta wing with subsonic leading edges .
