Patterns of Name Ordering among Authors of Scientific Papers:
A study of Social Symbolism and Its Ambiguity
   With increasing scientific collaboration, visibility of individual 
role-performance has diminished.. Ordering of author' names as an adaptive 
device which symbolizes their relative contributions to research.. Interviews 
with Nobel laureates and comparisons of their name-order practices to those of 
other scientists suggest that this symbol is ambiguous and makes evaluation of 
individual role-performance difficult.. A probability model of expected 
distribution of name orders is used in measuring preferences for particular 
sequences, and these preferences vary with the authors' eminence.. On the 
assumptions that authors' names are listed in order of the value of their 
contributions, laureates should be first-authors more often than other 
scientists; in fact, they are not.. Instead, they exercise their noblesse 
oblige by giving credit to less eminent co-workers increasingly as their 
eminence grows.. They do so more often after the prize, and eminent 
laureates-to-be forego first-authorship more often than  those as yet 
unrecognized.. The noblesse oblige, however, has its limits; laureates' 
contributions to prize-winning research are more visible than contributions to 
their other research..
