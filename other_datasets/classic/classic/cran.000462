photo-thermoelasticity .
  this paper summarizes the optical and physical
properties of the photoelastic model material paraplex p-43 over
the temperature range from room temperature to -40 f .
descriptions are presented of techniques and equipment
developed to obtain the modulus of elasticity, the material
fringe value, and the thermal-expansion coefficient as a
function of temperature .  experimental investigations
were conducted into the plane-stress problems of a disk
contracting upon an elastic inclusion and the transient
thermal-stress field produced by a temperature differential
suddenly applied to the upper edge of a long beam .  the
data are correlated with theory using the material
properties obtained in the calibration phase .  also included are
photographic results of an exploratory investigation of the
thermal-shock phenomenon produced by the sudden
application of a temperature differential upon plastic beams
of various length-depth ratios .
