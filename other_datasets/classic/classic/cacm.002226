Further Evidence for the Analysis of Algorithms
for the Zero-One Programming Problem
The purpose of this note is to report computational
experience additional to that recently 
summarized by Gue et al, with two algorithms for the
zero-one linear programming problem.  An error in 
Gue's paper is corrected.  The utility of one of
the algorithms as a suboptimizer is indicated.
