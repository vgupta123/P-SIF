transformation between compressible and incompressible
boundary layer equations .
transformation between compressible and incompressible
boundary layer equations .
it is proposed to show that the boundary-layer equation of
compressible flow can be reduced to that of incompressible
flow .  such work was initiated by stewartson and by rott and
crabtree .  in the following some of the restrictions imposed by
references 1 and 2 will be removed, and it will be shown that the
transformation from compressible boundary layer to
incompressible boundary layer can be applied to the laminar, as well as
turbulent, case .  a direct method will be used for this purpose .
