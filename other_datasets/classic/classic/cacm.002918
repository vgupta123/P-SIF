Multiprocessor Memory Organization and Memory Interference
The structure of shared memory in a multiprocessor
computer system is examined with particular 
attention to nonin terleaved memory.  Alternative memory
organizations are compared and it is shown that 
a home memory organization, in which each processor
is associated with one or more memories in which 
its address space is concentrated, is quite effective in
reducing memory in terference.  Home memory organization 
is shown to be particularly suited to certain specialized
computation problems as well as to possess 
advantages in terms of in terference and reliability for
general purpose computation.  Results for in terleaved 
memory are drawn from previous work and are used for
comparison.  Trace-driven simulations are used to 
verify the conclusions of the analysis.
