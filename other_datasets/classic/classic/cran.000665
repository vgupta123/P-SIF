on the theory of hypersonic gas flow with a power law
shock wave .
plane and axisymmetric hypersonic gas flows are considered with shock
waves of very great intensity that have a power-law form .  on the basis
of an investigation of the portions of the flow with high entropy
adjoining the surface of the body (not necessarily for a shock wave of the
given form) it is shown that the use in the flow problem of the exact
solution for the corresponding unsteady self-similar gas motion requires
a supplementary refinement of the thickness of the high entropy layer .
a method is shown for introducing such a correction and constructing the
shape of the body contour, on which is to be applied the pressure
distribution obtained on the basis of the theory of small disturbances .
