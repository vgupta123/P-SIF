compressible fluid .
an extension of the modified-oseen method of carrier, based on the
linearization of the viscous term of the von mises transformation,
is presented .  the method is employed to determine the velocity field
associated with the laminar axisymmetric jet flow of a compressible
gas with an arbitrary but constant external flow .  the approximate
solution is shown to be in good agreement with the exact numerical
calculation of pai .
in many boundary layer problems it is not possible to make the
assumption of flow similarity .  the solution in these cases can be
obtained either by laborious finite difference techniques or by
resort to approximate solutions .  carrier and lewis (1), and more
recently carrier (2), have suggested a method of obtaining approximate
solutions to problems involving convection and diffusion .  this
method, termed by carrier /the modified-oseen method/, overcomes an
essential difficulty of integral methods, namely, the generation of
reasonable profiles .  it is well known that the integral method gives
accurate results only if the analytical profiles represent closely
the true profiles .  according to the modified-oseen method the
convective operator in the original partial differential equation
is replaced by a linear one .  the resulting equation for the
boundary layer problem is the heat conduction equation which can be
treated by well-known techniques .
it is the purpose of this paper to indicate a modification of this
procedure and to demonstrate its simplicity and accuracy by treating the
axisymmetric laminar flow of a compressible gas with arbitrary but
constant external flow .  the modification is based on the use of the
von mises transformation with a subsequent linearization of the viscous
term, rather than the linearization of the convective term . pai's
problem (3), originally treated by a finite difference technique,
is considered to illustrate the effectiveness of this method .
