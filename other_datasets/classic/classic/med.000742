congenital atresia of
the extrahepatic bile ducts
because congenital atresia of the extra-
hepatic biliary tract is almost always fatal,
exception to this course becomes of interest.
the remarkable history of one such infant
was reported in 1960 when he had attained
the age of 2 1/2 years and, after three opera-
tions, he was in good health developing nor-
mally and free of jaundice.  since he is now
8 1/2 years of age, has had two more opera-
tions, is still free of jaundice, and is again
in good health, his further course since 1960
should be of interest.
