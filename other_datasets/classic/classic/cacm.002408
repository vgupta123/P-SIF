Solving the Biharmonic Equation in a Square:
A Direct Versus a Semidirect Method
Two methods for solving the biharmonic equation
are compared.  One method is direct, using 
eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition.  The other method
is iterative, solving a Poisson equation directly 
at each iteration.
