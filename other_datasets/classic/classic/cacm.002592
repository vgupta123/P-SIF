On Generation of Test Problems for Linear Programming Codes
Users of linear programming computer codes have
realized the necessity of evaluating the capacity, 
effectiveness, and accuracy of the solutions provided
by such codes.  Large scale linear programming 
codes at most installations are assumed to be generating correct
solutions without ever having been "bench-marked" 
by test problems with known solutions.  The reason for
this failure to adequately test the codes is that 
rarely are there large problems with known solutions readily
available.  This paper presents a theoretical 
justification and an illustrative implementation of a method
for generating linear programming test problems 
with known solutions.  The method permits the generation
of test problems that are of arbitrary size 
and have a wide range of numerical characteristics.
