stability of rectangular plates under shear and bending
forces .
  the author first discusses the problem of a plane, simply
supported rectangular plate loaded by shearing forces in
the plane of the plate on all four edges .  there are two
stiffeners attached one third and two thirds of the way
along the plate .  the critical load is calculated for various
stiffener rigidities .  also, the rigidity necessary to keep
the stiffeners straight when the plate buckles is found .
this stiffener rigidity is found to be slightly larger than
that necessary for a plate with one stiffener and the same
panel dimensions as the plate with two stiffeners .
  the second problem discussed by the author is that of a
plane, simply supported rectangular plate loaded by
uniformly distributed edge shearing forces in the plane of the
plate and linearly distributed tension and compression in
the plane of the plate at the ends .  the end forces vary
from tension, at one corner to, at the other corner,
so that their resultant is a bending moment .  the
presence of the edge shearing forces is found to diminish the
critical bending stress in this case .  calculations are made
for various magnitudes of bending and shearing forces for
plates of various proportions .
