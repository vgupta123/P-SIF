An Experimental Laboratory for Pattern Recognition and Signal Processing
An interactive computer-controlled scanning
and display system has been in operation at the 
IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center for three years.
 The system includes two flying-spot scanners and 
a TV camera specially interfaced to a process control
digital computer, dot-mode and vector displays, 
analog input and output facilities, and a variety of
other experimental equipment.  The system design 
and programming support are described and typical applications
in scanner control, optical character 
recognition,and image processing are presented.
