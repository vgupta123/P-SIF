the approximate analysis of certain boundary value
problems .
a simple method is given which is suitable
for the approximate analysis of certain
boundary-value problems, including, for
example, the small deflections of clamped
plates and the torsion of prismatic bars .
the analysis is particularly simple and lends
itself well to the use of the digital computer .
the method is applied here to four
problems, the uniformly loaded, clamped square,
and equilateral-triangle plates, and the
torsion of bars of square and hexagonal cross
section .  the results agree well with
the exact solutions, where these are known .
