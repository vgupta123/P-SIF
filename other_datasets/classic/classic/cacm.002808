The Lemniscate Constants
The lemniscate constants, and indeed some
of the methods used for actually computing them, 
have played an enormous part in the development of
mathematics.  An account is given here of some of 
the methods used-most of the derivations can be made
by elementary methods.  This material can be used 
for teaching purposes, and there is much relevant and
interesting historical material.  The acceleration 
methods developed for the purpose of evaluating
these constants are useful in other problems.
