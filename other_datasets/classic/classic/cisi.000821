Recent Growth of the Literature of Biochemistry 
and Changes in Ranking of Periodicals
   The ideas and techniques of physics have been systematically applied to the
study of living matter since the 1950s and 1960s.. As a result a rapid and 
large increase has taken place in the research activity in this field and 
biophysics and molecular biology have emerged as important areas of study.. The
consequent enormous growth of literature  in the field has created great 
difficulties in tracking out the significant literature of the subject.. To 
cope with this unprecedented growth of literature, a ranking list of periodicals
in this field has been prepared on the basis of citations in the Annual review 
of biochemistry for 1968, 1969, and 1970.. This list is expected to reflect the 
impact of literature on the progress of biochemical knowledge more accurately 
than the list prepared by Henkle in 1938.. The present list brings out the 
predominant position of biochemical research in the total scientific effort 
today, and the increasing bias of cognate disciplines towards biochemical
methodologies.. A method of analysis of the number of citations in relation to 
size of the journal concerned and average length of the papers published has been
developed and applied in this study.. The analysis yields three parameters which 
should be useful in assessing the actual scientific interest of a journal in 
relation to the number of paper published, compactness of the information 
content, and the scientific value of the paper in relation to compactness of 
presentation..
   The results of the present study have been discussed in relation to 
Bradford's Law of Scattering and an extension of the Law has been suggested, 
namely, that during phases of rapid and vigorous growth of knowledge in a 
scientific disciplines, articles of interest to that discipline appear in 
increasing numbers in periodicals distant from that field.. It is expected that 
the present ranking list will enable librarians and other professional workers 
in the field of biochemistry to select journals from the viewpoint of their 
significance to the active areas or present day biochemical research..
