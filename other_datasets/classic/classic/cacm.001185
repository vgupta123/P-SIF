A program to Solve the Pentomino Problem by the Recursive Use of Macros
A coding technique is described in which certain
macro-instructions are given lists as arguments 
and are thereby used recursively.  The discussion covers
primarily an example in which the technique 
is used to solve the pentomino problem-the problem of
fitting 12 pentominos without overlapping into 
a plane area formed of 60 elemental squares.
