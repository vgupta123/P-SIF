cancer chemotherapy by prolonged arterial
infusion
our current experience is reported with
136 patients treated by prolonged arterial
infusion chemotherapy.  the patients pre-
sented a variety of far advanced cancers un-
suitable for conventional surgical or roent-
gen therapy.  antimetabolite solution, either
methotrexate or a fluorinated pyrimidine,
was injected continuously through a small
plastic catheter into the unobstructed artery
to provide a high regional drug concentration
for days to weeks.  the patients have received
drug infusion for up to 45 days.  their course
has been followed for up to 37 months after
treatment.
methotrexate with antidote therapy by
systemic administration of citrovorum fac-
tor was used preferentially in most patients.
a fluorinated pyrimidine, most commonly,
5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine, was preferred for
hepatic artery infusion of liver metastases.
