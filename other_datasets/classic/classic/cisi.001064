Modern Manuscripts  A Practical Manual for Their Management, Care and Use
                The title of this book is intended to indicate
that its scope is limited to manuscripts of the seventeenth century
to the present.  Examples and techniques are drawn from institutions
in the United States with occasional references to practices in Great
Britain and Canada.  The book is directed toward the novice curator
of manuscripts, and, again, as the title indicates, it is intended to 
serve as a practical guide, not as an exposition of theory.
