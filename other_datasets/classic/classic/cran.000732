on the analogues relating flexure and extension of
flat plates .
  the displacement of a flat plate bent
by transverse loading, and the extensional
or in 'plane stress', are governed by equations
of identical form ,. and the boundary
conditions have identical form when
edge-displacements are specified in the flexural,
edge-tractions in the extensional problem,
so mathematically, in these circumstances,
only a single problem is presented .  this,
the 'first analogue' relating flexure and
extension, is well known .
  a 'second analogue', relating the flexural
problem when edge-tractions with the
extensional problem when edge-displacements
are specified, is believed to have been
first propounded in 1941 .  by introducing
two quantities u and v, analogous with
the components u and v of extensional
displacement, it permits a treatment of the
flexural problem by any method--e.g.
which yields extensional solutions of this
second type .
  in this paper both analogues are combined
in an inclusive statement covering the
perforated (multiply connected) plates which
were discussed in 1948 .  reasons are
stated for believing that 'two-diagram technique'
is preferable in problems governed
by 'mixed' boundary conditions .
