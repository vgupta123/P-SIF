Decomposability, Instabilities, and
Saturation in Multiprogramming Systems
A step-by-step approach to model the dynamic
behavior and evaluate the performance of computing 
systems is proposed.  It is based on a technique of variable
aggregation and the concept of nearly decomposable 
system, both borrowed from Econometrics.  This approach
is taken in order to identify in multiprogramming 
paging systems (i) unstable regimes of operations and (ii)
critical computing loads which bring the system 
into states of saturation.  This analysis leads to a
more complete definition of the circumstances in 
which "thrashing" can set in.
