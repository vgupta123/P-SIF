An Experiment in Index Term Frequency
   This paper presents an experimental study of index-term frequency as a factor
in retrieval performance.. The frequency of an index term, or its "breadth" as
it is called here, is the number of postings made to the term in a given 
collection.. The question is asked: Of index terms assigned to documents, which
function most effectively in retrieval, the most term or popular terms, or those
which are used relatively infrequently? The experiment is a retrieval experiment
and uses the Cranfield-Salton data.. Breadth of indexing is varied by 
nonrandomly deleting terms from documents.. Retrieval output is evaluated using 
the Expected Search Length measure of retrieval effectiveness as well as the 
usual precision and recall.. The Wilcoxen Test is used to determine the 
statistical significance of the different indexings.. The results show that the 
"optimal" breadth of indexing is a variable, depending on user needs: if a few
documents are wanted or high precision is desired, then narrow terms are more
effective than broad ones; if, on the other hand, all or most relevant documents
are wanted, then broad terms are better.. An argument, however, can be made for 
the quality of narrow terms, since when these terms are deleted precision never 
improves, whereas deleting broad terms always results in a higher precision.. A
corollary experiment is carried out to compare two indexings of the same
average breadth where one indexing consists of
semantically appropriate terms - terms taken from the document title - and the
other consists of merely "reasonable" index terms.. The result suggest that 
title-term indexing is qualifiedly superior..
