measurements of turbulent friction on a smooth flat plate in supersonic .
  direct measurements of supersonic local skin friction, using the
floating-element technique, are presented for mach numbers from
bulent flow and transition are emphasized, although some
measurements in the laminar regime are included .  the observed effect
of compressibility is to reduce the magnitude of turbulent skin
friction by a factor of two at a mach number of 4.5 and a
reynolds number of about 10 .
  the boundary-layer momentum-integral equation for constant
pressure is verified within a few per cent by two experimental
methods .  typical static pressure measurements are presented to
show that transition can be detected by observing disturbances
in pressure associated with changes in displacement thickness
of the boundary layer .
  it is found that the turbulent boundary layer cannot be defined
experimentally for values of less than about 2,000, where
is the momentum thickness .  for larger values of there is a
unique relationship between local friction coefficient and
momentum-thickness reynolds number at a fixed mach number .  the
appendix compares the present measurements at m = 2.5 with
experimental data from other sources .
