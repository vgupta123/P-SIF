Atom-by-Atom Typewriter Input for Computerized
Storage and Retrieval of Chemical Structures
  Novel features have been added to a paper tape typewriter having a removable
typing element.  A symbol set has been devised which requires only nine 
characters for typing common chemical structures.  The typewriter has an uncoded
"INDEX" key which advances the paper without carriage return.  A companion key,
"BACK INDEX," was provided which directly retracts the paper.  Both have been
coded.  A tape record containing information sufficient for a computer to 
calculate an atom-bond connection table for a chemical structure is obtained
by typing the structure in any order solely from the keyboard or by use of the
reader with prepunched tapes containing frequently occurring substructures.
Cost was about one-fourth that of earlier paper tape chemical typewriters.
