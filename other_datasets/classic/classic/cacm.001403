A Method for Finding the m Smallest Values of
a Monotonic Function Defined on Ordered Sets of 
Positive Integers
The minimum value of a monotonic increasing
function defined on a partially ordered set S is 
assumed on the set of minimal points of S.  This observation
is used to devise an efficient method for 
finding the m smallest functional values of monotonic
functions defined on ordered pairs of positive 
integers.  The method is easily extended to include
monotonic functions defined on ordered n-tuples. 
 Included is a FORTRAN program which was written to implement
the procedure for a certain important case.
