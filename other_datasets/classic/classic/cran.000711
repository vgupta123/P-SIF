reentry configuration having folding wingtip panels .
an investigation was made at subsonic speeds in the langley highspeed
lifting reentry configuration having folding wingtip panels . the
configuration is of the type used in a high angle-of-attack /near 90degree/
 reentry to minimize aerodynamic heating . by unfolding the wingtip
panels into the airstream, a moderate angle-of-attack glide is used for
a controlled landing . the basic configuration tested utilized a
whose area was 25 percent of the total wing area . the effects of
varying the plan form and size of the wingtip panels was studied as well
 as the effects of unfolding the wingtip panels in a high angle-
of-attack attitude . tests were made at mach numbers of 0.40, 0.60, and
