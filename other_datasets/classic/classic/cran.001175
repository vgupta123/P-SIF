stresses from local loadings in cylindrical pressure
vessels .
  a short discussion is given of the possible methods for
computing the stresses caused in cylindrical shells by local
loadings .  it is concluded that the method of developing
the loads and displacements into double fourier series
leads to formulas which are best suited for numerical
evaluation .  with this method the pertinent expressions
for the displacements caused by radial loads are found by
reducing the three partial differential equations of the
shell theory to an eighth-order differential equation in the
radial displacements, which is similar to, but not identical
with, those derived by donnell and yuan .  insertion of the
fourier series for the radial displacements and the external
loading in this equation leads directly to a double series
expression of the radial displacement w in terms of the load
factors of the radial load .  this results in the pertinent
expressions for the other displacements and for the
bending moments and membrane forces .  the cases of radial
loading considered here and those which can be reduced to
it are (a) a load uniformly distributed within a rectangle,
tion, uniformly distributed over a short distance in the
circumferential direction, (d) a moment in the
circumferential direction, uniformly distributed over a short
distance in the longitudinal direction .  for all these
loadings the load factors, which have to be used in the
pertinent formulas for the displacements, bending
moments, and membrane forces, are computed .  for the case
of tangential loading an eighth-order differential
equation is derived in terms of the radial displacement and the
tangential load .  using this equation, formulas for the
displacements, bending moments, and membrane forces for
tangential loading within a rectangle are found .
