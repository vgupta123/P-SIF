The Extension on Users' Literature Awareness as a Measure of Retrieval 
Performance, and Its Application to MEDLARS
   The performance of a retrieval system with a file of only a few hundred 
references can be measured by assessing the relevance of each reference to each 
of a number of queries.. A suitable measure of retrieval performance is then the
Recall ratio - the fraction of the relevant references that are retrieved by the
system.. When the file is large this method of measuring performance is not 
practicable, and Recall cannot be measured although it can be estimated.. A
number of estimation procedures are examined and found unsatisfactory.. Another
measure of retrieval performance is the Extension ratio which is approximately
the ratio of the quantity of known relevant references before and after putting 
a query to the retrieval system.. The properties of this measure are examined 
and it is applied to 315 MEDLARS searches..
