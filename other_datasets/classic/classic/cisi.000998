The Other Half of Cataloging
   The authors investigate the impact of a bibliographic retrieval/card
production system, such as the Ohio College Library Center (OCLC), with special
attention to its role in cataloging.. Activities required at the local level to
make the LC card a functioning component of the catalog are described.. The
characteristics of the ensuring workload are examined, along with methods of
accomplishing it.. These activities are seen as a factor in the persistence of
backlogs.. The design of OCLC, because of the immobility of the terminal and
the absence of the catalog from the data base, by-passes this workload, leaving 
the local library to accomplish it by the method of its choice, as before, or 
to leave it undone..
