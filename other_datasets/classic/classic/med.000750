lesions of the liver in hereditary
metabolic diseases
whether the various cells of the liver, both parenchymal and stromal,
receive genetic misinformation in all hereditary diseases caused by gene
mutation is unknown, but the metabolic capabilities of these several cell
types are so diverse that it is not surprising that their involvement in
many such diseases can be demonstrated by clinical, pathological, or bio-
chemical methods.  repetitive abnormality of the liver has apparently not
been defined for any disease caused by quantitative (i.e., chromosomal)
gene anomaly, whether produced by nondisjunction, translocation, or
major deletion, perhaps because relatively few such diseases have been
described.  as a result, the genetically determined disorders of the liver
surveyed in this paper appear to be the result of conventional "single
gene" abnormalities, and to be transmitted in affected families by men-
delian mechanisms.
