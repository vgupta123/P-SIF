1848. antigen analysis of sera from patients with malignant
tumors by immunodiffusion methods
immunoelectrophoresis and ouchterlony's
method were used for the antigen analy-
sis of sera from 320 cancer patients; 250
normal or non-tumorous cases served as
controls.  immunoelectrophoresis showed
abnormal precipitin lines which could not
be demonstrated in normal sera.  most of
the abnormal antigens were demonstrated
in the a2- and b1-globulin fractions.  the
distribution of these antigens differed in
individual cases and was not related to the
histopathological classification and site
of the tumors.  however, these antigens
increased in parallel with growth of the
tumors and disappeared or markedly
decreased after surgical removal of the tumor
tissue.  almost all sera of patients with
myeloma, leukemia, and malignant lymph-
oma formed one characteristic line in
the b2-globulin region and they could be dif-
ferentiated from the patterns in cases of carcinoma.
