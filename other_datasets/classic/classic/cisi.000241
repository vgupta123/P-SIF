A Brief guide to Sources of Scientific and Technical Information
  This guide is a recapitulation and refinement of the substantive
content of a one-and-a-half day course which was given before
three groups of Federal scientists and engineers during the Fall of
1967.  Its purpose was to train and inform
working scientists and engineers as to the most direct and efficient
means of seeking and acquiring work-related information.
  The impetus for the course was the recognition of the growing
need for working scientists and engineers to share and participate
in the existing and emerging information tools and mechanisms,
and to avail themselves of the opportunities afforded by the newer
approaches to information collection, organization, and dissemination. 
A further, related purpose of the course was to facilitate the
fullest possible participation of the working scientist and engineer 
in the evolution of information services and mechanisms which are
likely to have a greater and greater effect on his professional
activities.
