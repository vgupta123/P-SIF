tables of exact laminar-boundary layer solutions when

  the three partial differential equations of the laminar boundary
layer for two-dimensional steady-state compressible flow have been
transformed into two ordinary differential equations by the method of
pohlhausen, falkner, and skan .  the ordinary equations include
parameters for expressing the simultaneous effects of pressure gradient in
the main-stream flow through a porous wall and property changes in the
fluid due to large temperature differences between the wall and the
free stream .
  a total of 58 cases have been solved numerically by the method of
picard .  the euler number (nondimensional pressure-gradient parameter)
ranges in value from 1 (stagnation-point value) to the negative values
found at the laminar separation points .  three rates of flow through
the porous wall were considered (including the impermeable case where
the flow rate is 0) .  five temperature ratios (stream temperature
divided by wall temperature) were used ..  the uncooled and unheated
case (temperature ratio of 1), two cooled cases (temperature ratios of
ture ratios of and ) .  velocity, weight-flow, and temperature
distributions are tabulated as are the dimensionless stream function of
falkner and skan and its derivatives and the dimensionless temperature
function of pohlhausen and its derivatives .
  for each case, displacement, momentum, and convection thicknesses,
as well as nusselt number and coefficient of friction at the wall, were
computed .
