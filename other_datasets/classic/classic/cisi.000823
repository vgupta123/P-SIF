Measuring the Goodness of Library Services:
A General Framework for Considering Quantitative Measures
  The literature of the last few decades reflects a steadily increasing
concern with quantitative assessment of libraries and their services.  This
concern is both the result of, and a reaction to, growing pressures from
within and without the library profession to adopt the tools of the
management sciences.  The pressures are generated by many factors including
the success of these tools in other fields and their adoption by the
organizations supporting libraries, the increasingly explicit character
of competition for funds at all levels, and the complexity and critical
nature of decisions on the host of new options being created by technology
and by formalization of library networks.
