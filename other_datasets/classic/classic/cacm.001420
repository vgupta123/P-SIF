A New Uniform Pseudorandom Number Generator
A new multiplicative congruential pseudorandom
number generator is discussed, in which the 
modulus is the largest prime within accumulator capacity
and the multiplier is a primitive root of that 
prime.  This generator passes the usual statistical
tests and in addition the least significant bits 
appear to be as random as the most significant bits-a
property which generators having modulus 2^k do 
not possess.
