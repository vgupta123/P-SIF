AACR 6: Time for a Review
   Two changes are proposed in the North American text of rule 6 of the
Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR): the adoption of the British text of 6B
and the deletion of 6C.. Both of these changes are intended to simplify the
entry of serials.. With the deletion of 6C, serials would be entered only under 
title or corporate author.. The adoption of the British text od 6B would in turn
greatly simplify the remaining choice between title or corporate author..
