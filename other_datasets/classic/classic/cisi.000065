A Study of Searching the Eye Research Literature
   The paper is a report of most of the major findings of a study in searching
the periodical eye research literature.. Questions were collected from eye 
researchers and a selected group of these were searched in nine different 
secondary sources.. Articles thought to be relevant were Xeroxed and sent to 
the eye researchers who subsequently rated the articles.. Articles of eye
research interest are found in a wide variety of journals, but a small number
of journals carry a large proportion of the articles judged valuable by the eye
researchers.. Approximately a fourth of eye research articles are in foreign 
languages.. Translations are not readily available.. Despite a delay of more 
than 15 month between the original appearance of article in journals and the 
mailing of photocopies, about half of the articles of interest to the 
researchers were not known to them previously.. For extensive retrospective
searches more than one secondary service must be used.. Index Medicus and 
Excerpta Medica (Section 12) or Ophthalmic Literature would be good sources..
MEDLARS demand searches were not shown to be clearly superior to manual 
searches of Index Medicus.. Titles, abstracts, and full text were shown to be
equally effective in permitting searches to retrieve references that were
subsequently rated as relevant by the researchers.. A searcher with a background
in ophthalmology was able to retrieve more articles of research interest than 
other non-ophthalmologist searchers..
