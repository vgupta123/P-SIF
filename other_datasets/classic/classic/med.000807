group psychotherapy with preschool
psychotic children and collateral
group therapy of their parents:
a preliminary report of the first two years
a group approach in the treatment of preschool-aged psychotic children is
reported.  autism is a defense against loss of the symbiotic partner.  the
group of children penetrates this defense and forms a "group ego," which
constitutes one pole of a new therapeutic symbiosis from which
separation-individuation can occur.
