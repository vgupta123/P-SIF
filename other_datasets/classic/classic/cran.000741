the behaviour of thin cylindrical shells after buckling
under axial compression .
  the fundamental investigations of von karman and tsien
on the buckling of cylindrical shells under axial compression
are continued .  the energy expression is simplified and
minimized with respect to the axial and circumferential wave-length
parameters .  solution of the equations obtained yields curves
of the reduced average stress and of the wave dimensions plotted
against the reduced average strain .  they illustrate the behavior
of the cylinder during the buckling process .  the minimum
buckling stress is found to be 0.195e(tr) .
