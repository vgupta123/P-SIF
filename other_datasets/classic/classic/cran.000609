on three dimensional bodies of delta planform which
can support plane attached shock waves .
  this note collects together in one report available theoretical work
on bodies which can support attached plane shock waves, discusses some
of the possible merits of such shapes, and includes some calculations
illustrating their properties .  also, some preliminary results from
wind tunnel tests are given, together with details of proposed future
tests .
