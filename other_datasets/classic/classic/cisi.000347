CAS computer-Based Information Services
  This paper describes the key points that characterize
CAS' approach to large scale scientific-technical information
systems that must handle over 100,000 documents per year.
The first of these points is the "single analysis/multiple
use" concept.  Intellectual ability is a rare commodity 
and essential to an information service.  Therefore, it makes
sense to conserve that commodity and not use manpower to
perform repetitive jobs or to waste effort analyzing information.
