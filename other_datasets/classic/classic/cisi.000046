A Quantitative Measure of User Circulation Requirements and Its Possible
Effect on Stack Thinning and Multiple Copy Determination
   The strategy outlined in this article describes a possible aid to the 
librarian for thinning a library's stack according to the criterion of user 
needs.. The method uses the last circulation date as a parameter of user 
circulation requirements.. The resulting stack collection would, by design,
satisfy over 99 percent of the user circulation requirements and yet be of
minimum size.. Preliminary, but not yet fully validated research, indicates 
that the number of volumes in a library's holdings may be reduced by 60 to 70 
percent and yet satisfy well over 99 percent of the user requirements.. It may
also be possible to determine which books should have multiple copies in order
that user disappointment can be minimized.. The effective result of this 
approach is that there now may be a quantitative method of maintaining the 
library's holdings at a reasonable level and, in addition, a reduction in the 
disappointment of the user who is unable to find the book he wants because of 
use by another..
