Analysis of Search Key Retrieval on a Large Bibliographic File
   Two research keys (4,5 and 3,3) are analyzed using a probability formula on
a bibliographic file of 857,725 records.. Assuming random requests by record 
permits the creation of a predictive model which more closely approximates 
the actual behavior of a search and retrieval system as determined by a usage 
survey..
