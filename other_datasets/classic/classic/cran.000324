vorticity effect on the stagnation point flow of a viscous
incompressible fluid .
the effect of vorticity on axisymmetric stagnation point boundary layer
calculations is investigated by calculating a perturbation to the
stagnation point flow . the shear caused by the vorticity effect is
found to be surprisingly large,.the slope of the shear curve /at zero
vorticity/ as calculated by kemp agrees perfectly with the value deduced
 in this note .
