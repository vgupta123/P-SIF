Libraries at Large
    This book, Libraries at Large, is itself one tangible outcome of Advisory 
Commission activity, representing the combined efforts of Duke University,
the R.R. Bowker Company, members of the Commission and its several study
groups, and many other diverse individuals within and without the library
world.  The resultant theme is the same one that characterized the work of
our Commission from the beginning - namely, a concern that every individual
in our society be provided with library and informational services adequate
to his current and emerging needs.  Confronting this goal requires a
recognition of inevitable change, and we have questioned status quo, 
recognizing at the same time the differing pace and character requisite
for the implementation of designs in the adaptability to change.  The
national interest demands simultaneous sympathy with people in pockets of
illiteracy and people in the vanguards of intellectual achievement.
