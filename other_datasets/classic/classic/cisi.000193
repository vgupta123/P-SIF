Use of Medical and Biological Journals in the Yale Medical Library
  This paper presents data for the end of 1960 on recorded use of some
two hundred of the most often used scientific and medical journals in the
Yale Medical Library.  The investigation was designed to identify the most
abundantly used titles of recent date of publication to guide the 
acquisition of multiple subscriptions.  At the same time data was collected
to distinguish heavily used back sets.
