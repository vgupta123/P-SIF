dandy-walker-taggart 'syndrome' (a case report).
dandy-walker-taggart 'syndrome' in a
6-month-old girl has been substantiated by a
correlation of clinical and pathological
features.  all 3 exit foramina of the 4th
ventricle have failed to open, resulting in
severe cystic dilatation of the ventricle and
hypoplastic distortion of posterior midline
cerebellar structures.
