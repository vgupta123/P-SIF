an investigation of wing-aileron flutter using ground
launched rocket models .
  control surface flutter of the
wing torsion-control rotation type has
been investigated for an unswept wing
with an under-massbalanced, half span,
outboard aileron .  thirteen pairs of
wings were tested, using ground launched
rocket driven vehicles, and a range of
values of aileron natural frequency
was covered .  the test results showed
considerable scatter, but enabled
upper and lower limits of a flutter
boundary to be determined approximately .
it was established that aileron flutter
could be eliminated on the models
tested provided the aileron frequency
exceeded the wing torsional frequency
by 20 per cent or more .  in this
condition the models were also free from
single degree of freedom flutter
