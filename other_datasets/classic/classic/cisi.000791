Empirical Hyperbolic Distributions (Bradford-Zipf-Mandelbrot)
for Bibliometric Description and Prediction
  Since 1960, and especially during the past three years, many papers have
appeared about particular manifestations and applications of a certain class
of empirical laws to a field that may be labelled conveniently 'Bibliometrics'.
This term, resuscitated by Alan Pritchard (see page 348), denotes,
in my paraphrase, quantitative treatment of the properties of recorded
discourse and behaviour appertaining to it.
  In this field the law cited is usually that named after Bradford or
Zipf according to whether the interest is in vocabulary or periodical
literature or physical access, in the rate of diminishing returns, or in the
cumulative yield from a given input.  The behaviour is hyperbolic; that is,
the product of fixed powers of the variables is constant.  This type of
behaviour has been observed for a century or so in fields ranging from
meteorology to economics, and has given rise to many particular explanations
appropriate to the particular fields.  Thus it has received many names 
according to its exponents, in both senses of that word.
