A Note on the Dangling Else in ALGOL 60
Some revisions of ALGOL 60 are proposed, which
not only eliminate certain ambiguous statements 
but also add some convenience to the language.  A discussion
of the background of the problem and a sketch 
of a proof that the ambiguities have been removed is included.
