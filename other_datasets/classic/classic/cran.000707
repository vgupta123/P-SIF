thermal analysis of stagnation regions with emphasis on heat-sustaining
nose shapes at hypersonic speeds .
the leading edges and noses of hypersonic vehicles are subjected to
severe aerodynamic heating and must be cooled in some manner-dash e.g.,
internal convection, transpiration, or radiation . it is this latter
mode of handling the problem that is discussed in this paper .
neglecting conduction in the leading-edge region, the maximum temperature for
long-range hypersonic gliders is of the same order as the melting point
of refractory materials, with a corresponding large temperature gradient
 away from the leading edge . inclusion of conduction in the aft
direction reduces the maximum temperature and distributes the heat to a
location that will radiate it out from the surface . for either
steady-state or transient conditions, the temperature at the leading edge is
reduced by conduction, while the temperature aft of the leading-edge
shoulder is increased, thus setting up a heat transmission balance
between the convective influx of heat, the redistribution of heat by
conduction, and the radiation of heat from the surface . the feasibility of
 such a mechanism can be enhanced by suitably choosing leading-edge
shapes and materials . the philosophy behind the choice of leading-edge
shapes is discussed and the effects of varying parameters, such as
shape, diameter, emissivity, conductivity, thickness, etc., are shown .
