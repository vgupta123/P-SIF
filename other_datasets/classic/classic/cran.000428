the quasi-cylinder of specified thickness and shell
loading in supersonic flow .
  the methods of the operational
calculus are used to obtain a linear
approximation to the shape of the mean camber
surface of a quasi-cylinder in a
supersonic flow in terms of its shell thickness
and loading distributions .  the
analysis deals with a generalised quasi-cylinder ,.
that is one which, although lying
close to a mean cylinder, need not possess
axial symmetry .  the quasi-cylinder
is also permitted to be within the small
disturbance field of other separate
components, e.g. a centre-body .  because
the linearised theory is inadmissable
for internal duct flows close to and beyond
the first reflected characteristic cone,
the present solution is likewise invalid close
to and beyond the position where
this characteristic meets the mean cylinder .
the work given here enables the
camber shapes of /ring-wings/, which have
been used theoretically to reduce or
even nullify the wave-drag of a central slender-body,
to be found .  an example
illustrates the general method .
