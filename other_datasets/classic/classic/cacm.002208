Storage Utilization in a Memory Hierarchy When Storage
Assignment Is Performed by a Hashing Algorithm
The utilization of storage is studied in a two-level
memory hierarchy.  The first storage level, 
which is the fast store, is divided into a number of
storage areas.  When an entry is to be filed in 
the hierarchy, a hashing algorithm will attempt to
place the entry into one of these areas.  If this 
particular area is full, then the entry will be placed
into the slower second-level store, even though 
other areas in the first-level store may have space
available.  Given the N entries have been filed in 
the entire hierarchy, an expression is derived for the
expected number of entries filed in the first-level 
store.This expression gives a measure of how effectively
the first-level store is being used.  By means 
of examples, storage utilization is then studied as a
function of the hashing algorithm, the number of 
storage areas into which the first-level store is divided
and the total size of the first-level store.
