nonlinear heat transfer problem .
  a study has been made of the time-dependent heat
conduction in a semi-infinite medium subject to a
boundary condition which can involve the temperature
in a nonlinear manner .  a formulation for the
determination of the surface temperature, which is often
of greatest physical interest, leads to a nonlinear
volterra integral equation .  a simple iterative solution
method, with an accuracy suitable for many practical
purposes is presented .  as an example, the problem
of the time-dependent surface temperature of a body
receiving heat according to the stefan-boltzmann law
is treated .  the analysis is also applicable to physical
adsorption or chemisorption processes which occur at
the boundary .
