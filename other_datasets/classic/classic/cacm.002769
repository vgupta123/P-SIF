A Modification of Warshall's Algorithm for
the Transitive Closure of Binary Relations
An algorithm is given for computing the transitive
closure of a binary relation that is represented 
by a Boolean matrix. The algorithm is similar to Warshall's
although it executes faster for sparse matrices
on most computers, particularly in a paging environment.
