current concepts in the management
of congenital biliary atresia
the current management of congenital
biliary atresia at the university of cali-
fornia, los angeles is reviewed.
biliary enteric decompression was
performed on 18 of the 27 patients, eight
of whom are presently alive (29.6%).
these figures are higher than the cure rate
of 8% previously reported.
described recently.  five additional patients
with extrahepatic atresia underwent biliary
decompression by means of a hepatic
lymphaticojejunostomy.
early diagnosis of biliary atresia is im-
perative in order that any corrective sur-
gery may be performed before advanced
biliary cirrhosis develops.
