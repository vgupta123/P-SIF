Machine Calculation of Moments of a Probability Distribution
A method is presented for the calculation on a
machine of the moments of a probability distribution, 
necessitating little more than n additions and n references
to memory for each moment, instead of the 
minimum of n multiplication, 2n additions, and 2n references
to memory required by the most straightforward 
method (where n is the number of entries in the probability
distribution).  The method is directly applicable 
when a tabulated distribution exists, as when it has
been computed by repeated convolution; but in this 
case it conserves both time and accuracy.
