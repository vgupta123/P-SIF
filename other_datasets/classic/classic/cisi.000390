Factors Determining the Performance of Indexing Systems
  The test results are presented for a number of different index languages
using various devices which affect recall or precision.  Within the environment
of this test, it is shown that the best performance was obtained with
the group of eight index languages which used single terms.  The group of
fifteen index languages which were based on concepts gave the worst performance,
while a group of six index languages based on the Thesaurus of
Engineering Terms of the Engineers Joint Council were intermediary.  Of
the single term index languages, the only method of improving performance
was to group synonyms and word forms, and any broader groupings of terms
depressed performance.  The use of precision devices such as links gave no
advantage as compared to the basic device of simple coordination.
