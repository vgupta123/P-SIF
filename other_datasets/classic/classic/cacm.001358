Syntax Macros and Extended Translation
A translation approach is described which allows
one to extended the syntax and semantics of 
a given high-level base language by the use of a new
formalism called a syntax-macro.  Syntax-macros 
define string transformations based on syntactic elements
of the base language.  Two types of macros 
are discussed, and examples are given of their use.  The
conditional generation of macros based on options 
and alternatives recognized by the scan are also described.
