Information Gathering Patterns and Creativity
A study of research chemists in an industrial research laboratory
   A comparison of creative and "noncreative" research chemists with 
respect to the ways in which they use their professional and technical 
literature.. The creative chemists differ from the "noncreative" in that the
former read more technical literature on the job, are less reluctant to use 
literature of greater reading difficulty, are less influenced in their 
independence of thought, read more extensively and consult more frequently the
older material, are more inquisitive and have broader cultural interests.. The
findings of the study are believed to be helpful in planning library and 
information services, in refining future inquiries into the ways in which
scientists use recorded information, and in improving tests for the 
identification of creative ability among chemists..
