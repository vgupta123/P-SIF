pharyngoplasty in speech
where adequate palate repair is undertaken at 1 year there is no indication
for pharyngoplasty as well at that age.
pharyngoplasty is indicated as a "supportive" operation only when the
result of the palate repair can be assessed (5 years plus), and where the
speech result proves disappointing.
the figure of 171 pharyngoplastics in 944 cases applies to the known speech
results up to april 1963.  it follows that with follow-up of the more recent
primary cases pharyngoplasty may well be necessary in some.
the hynes pharyngoplasty has proved to be the most satisfactory.
