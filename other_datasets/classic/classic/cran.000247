the calculation of the pressure distribution on thick
wings of small aspect ratio at zero lift in subsonic
flow .
  the method of expressing the velocity increment
over aerofoils directly in terms of the section ordinates
wings of finite aspect ratio .  the wings considered are
untapered in plan-form but may be tapered in thickness .
the section can be of any given shape so that in this sense
the analysis is more general than that of refs. 3 to 6 which
deal with wings of biconvex section .
  the coefficients required in the calculation are tabulated
for the centre-section of straight and swept-back wings
of aspect ratios 0.5,. 1,. 2,. and 4, the wing of infinite
aspect ratio having been
treated in ref. 1 .  the remaining calculations can be made
very quickly .
  since wings of very small aspect ratio can be treated also by
the method of slender-body theory, the relations between
linear theory, slender-body theory, and linearised slender-body
theory are discussed .  for the special case of ellipsoids,
the results obtained from the various methods are compared
with the exact solution .
