The Development of a Semantic Differential to
Assess Users' Attitudes Towards An On-line Interactive
Reference Retrieval System
   A semantic differential (SD) is a commonly used instrument which can
be used to reliably measure attitude toward a variety of objects or
concepts.. Each SD consists of a series of bipolar adjective scales on
which a respondent reacts, in relation to the object or concept of interest..
To interpret completed SDs, it simplifies the procedures and aids in the
development of theory if the adjective scales are grouped into one or more
independent clusters.. The primary purpose of this study was to identify
those clusters (or dimensions) applied by a user of an on-line user-oriented
reference retrieval system when he reacts toward such a system..
   Seventy-one who used or were familiar with a working on-line reference
retrieval system completed a packet of 20 SDs, each consisting of the same
19 adjective scales.. The correlations among the scales were factor 
analyzed.. Three independent dimensions were identified.. Factor I was 
labeled "evaluative-specific" and accounted for over 23% of the total
variance.. Factor II was called "desirability"; it accounted for over 
17% of the total variance.. And, Factor III, entitled "enormity" accounted
for over 10% of the total variance.. Another analysis showed the factor
structure to be highly reliable.. Therefore, if the derived three
dimensional structure underlies users' attitudes toward a more general
class of retrieval systems, then undimensional or unstructured system
evaluation of users' attitudes will be simplistic and possibly misleading..
   In order to construct a working semantic differential, 10 adjective
scales were identified which best represented the three dimensions..
Brief instructions are included which outline how to use this SD..
The discussion is mainly concerned with the obtained factor structure
and the need for a predicative replication of the study..
