Multiple Byte Processing with Full-Word Instructions
A method is described which allows parallel
processing of packed data items using only ordinary 
full-word computer instructions, even though the processing
requires operations whose execution is contingent 
upon the value of a datum.  It provides a useful technique
for processing small data items such as alphanumeric 
characters.
