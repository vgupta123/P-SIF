Economic Analysis of the Public Libraries
  This study addresses itself to several questions important to all public
libraries.  How should the library allocate its book budget?  What kinds of
books should it tend to buy?  What types of households use the library?  Why
do some households not use the library?  What is the cost of the various
services provided by the library?  What specific steps can the library take
to improve its services?  What are the library's options in choosing among the
different circulation systems?  For how long should the library allow books to
be checked out?  How frequently should overdue notices be sent out?  Is an
investment in a security system worthwhile?
  We have studied these questions in the context of one public library - the
Beverly Hills (California) Public Library - and have developed a methodology
for determining answers to them, as well as to other questions that arose
during our investigation.  Although answers will vary from library to library,
our methodology is quite general and should prove useful at many public 
libraries.
