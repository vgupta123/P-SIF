A Theory of Term Importance in Automatic Text Analysis
   A good deal of work has been done over the years in an attempt to use 
statistical or probabilistic techniques as a basis of automatic indexing and
content analysis.. 
   Unfortunately, many of these methods are lacking in effectiveness, and the
more refined procedures are computationally unattractive..
   A new technique, known as discrimination value analysis, ranks the text 
words in accordance with how much they are able to discriminate the documents
of a collection from each other; that is, the value of a term depends on how
much the average separation between individual documents changes when the given 
term is assigned for content identification.. The best words are those which
achieve the greatest separation.. 
   The discrimination value analysis is computationally simple, and it assigns 
a specific role in content analysis to single words, juxtaposed words and 
phrases, and word groups or thesaurus categories..  Experimental results are 
given showing the effectiveness of the technique..
