A Language for Treating Geometric Patterns in a Two-dimensional space
In this paper CADEP, a problem-oriented language
for positioning geometric patterns in a two-dimensional 
space, is presented.  Although the language has been
specifically designed for the automatic generation 
of integrated circuit masks, it turns out to be well
suited also for such other placement problems as 
architecture design, urban planning, logical and block
diagram representation.  The design criteria, 
the structure, and the specific features of CADEP are illustrated.
