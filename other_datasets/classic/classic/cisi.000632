Co-citation in the Scientific Literature: A New Measure of the
Relationship Between Two Documents
   A new form of document coupling called co-citation is defined as the
frequency with which two documents are cited together.. The co-citation
frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists
of citing documents in the Science Citation Index and counting identical 
entries.. Networks of co-cited papers can be generated for specific
scientific specialties, and an example is drawn from the literature
of particle physics.. Co-citation patterns are found to differ 
significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agree
generally with patterns of direct citation.. Clusters of co-cited
papers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science..
They may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of SDI 
profiles..
