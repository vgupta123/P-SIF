acoustical signal detection in turbulent airflow .
  improvement in detected signal-to-noise ratio is obtained
for a periodic signal masked by additive noise
and turbulent noise backgrounds .  comparisons are made
between autocorrelation, crosscorrelation, and a
combination of frequency filtering and crosscorrelation .
although the latter method provided the greatest
improvement, the crosscorrelation technique was the
most successful single method .  it turned out that
the maximum improvement obtainable was limited by
the dynamic range of the correlator computer and
not by errors due to finite averaging time and scanning
the delay .  the improvement for signals masked by
turbulent noise was found to be about 5 db less than that
obtained for additive noise .
