Facsimile Transmission in Libraries:  A State of the Art Survey
  Facsimile transmission is the rapid transmission of printed
pages from one point to another using electronic devices.  All facsimile 
transmission methods require converting the original picture into
an electrical impulse which is then transmitted over telephone lines,
private lines, microwave, or a combination of these communication
links.  The receiving unit reconverts the electrical impulse into an exact
duplicate of the original document on a screen or in the form of a hard
copy.
