The Evaluation of Information Services and Products
  The continuing need to put scientists in contact with the research of
others, coupled with the rapidly expanding volume of published
material during the past several decades, has placed new emphasis on
the old arts of assembling, coding, and disseminating recorded
knowledge.  In some instances, the emphasis has manifested itself in
research on improvement of traditional library systems.  In other
instances, it has resulted in the assembly of specialized collections and
their intensive indexing for access in a variety of ways.  Still other
systems have progressed from the passive role of responding to
requests to the active role of supplying documents, or references to
them, to researchers as the documents become available.  For lack of a
more descriptive terminology, all of these activities are referred to in
this book as "document transfer systems," implying that the product
being retrieved (or disseminated) is a document rather than the
information (if any) in it.  That is, intelligence systems or fact retrieval
systems (if facts are indeed retrieved) are excluded from our concern.
The document, of course, may be a book, a journal article, a drawing,
an abstract, a piece of film, or a piece of magnetic tape.
