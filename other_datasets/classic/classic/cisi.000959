Measures of Library Effectiveness
   Mathematical models of library operations are presented, allowing managers to
estimate measures of effectiveness for a library.. These models describe the
amount of use made of resources by a user in a visit, the distribution of book
circulation in a collection, the dependence of circulation on time, and the 
effect of multiple copies on user satisfaction.. Predictions are made on the 
basis of the models of the consequence of breaking of central library into 
branch libraries.. The effect, in terms of frustrated use, of removing the 
least-used books from a collection is discussed, as are strategies for for
duplication.. The emphasis is on facilitating getting results from models; for
this purpose graphic techniques supplement the mathematical formulas..
