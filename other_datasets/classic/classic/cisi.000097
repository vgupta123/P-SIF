Bibliographical Citation Characteristics of the Psychological
Journal Network in 1950 and in 1960
  The aforementioned studies are related to the
problem of information exchange in psychology.
Journals are a part of the formal channel of scientific
communication as well as storage elements for
the summary accounts of research undertakings.
Analysis of bibliographical citations thus can
reveal certain characteristics of the pattern of
information flow created by scientists in their
work.  The potential usefulness of this type of
investigation is increased when it becomes
possible to examine the trends through time of the
communication network under consideration, and also 
when different communication networks can be compared.
  The present paper deals with some of the
characteristics of bibliographical citations in the
same 21 psychological journals published both in
1950 and in 1960. The list of journals used, along
with the abbreviations to be used here, is given in
Table 1; it includes 8 journals published by the
American Psychological Association and 13 journals
published by other organizations.
