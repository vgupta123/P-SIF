Automatic Indexing and Generation of Classification Systems by Algorithm
   A system of automatic indexing based on Baye's theorem is described 
briefly.. In assigning 124 documents to 9 categories, there were 97 cases of 
agreement with professional indexers.. Using a collection factor, based on 87 
per cent human consistency from other courses, the computer appears then to 
index with 90 per cent accuracy in this case..
   The technique is then used with two randomized sample document groups drawn
from nine categories.. Each group in turn is used as the basis for indexing the
other.. The computer knows only the number of categories.. After 8 cycles the 
computer is found to have formed 9 groups consisting of about 50 per cent of 
documents that were also lumped together by professional indexers on the basis 
of subject content..
   A new measure of performance is proposed and some other applications of the 
technique indicated..
