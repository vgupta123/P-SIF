Is Journal Publication Obsolescent?
  Orderly communication through research journals may be jeopardized by a
developing national information system that is beginning to encroach on the
domain of the primary publication system.  The author also believes mass
distribution of unedited, unreferred and often unproofed preprints, which
has recently been proposed, would put journals out of business or transform
them into depositories.
