Compilation of Thesauri for Use in Computer Systems
  A thesaurus can be defined as a structured vocabulary for use in information
storage and retrieval systems.
  Three parts of this definition need further elaboration:
  1. A vocabulary is a collection of terms.
  2. The structure of a vocabulary can be described as a set of relationships
     between terms.
  3. Utilization of a thesaurus in an information system involves a set of
     rules which take into account the characteristics of the system.
