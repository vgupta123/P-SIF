asymptotic solutions of toroidal shell problems .
asymptotic solutions of toroidal shell problems .
  method of asymptotic integration developed by e. reissner and
author is refined, and solutions previously obtained for problems
of bending of curved tube and of a toroidal expansion joint
subject to an axial force are generalized and extended .  results are
compared to those obtained by l. beskin .  for large values of a
certain parameter, agreement is good .
