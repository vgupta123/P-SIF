the 7 x 7 in . hypersonic wind tunnel at rae farnborough,
part 1, design, instrumentation and flow visualization
techniques .
  this is the first of three parts of
the calibration report on the r.a.e.
  some details of the design and lay-out
of the plant are given, together
with the calculated performance figures,
and the major components of the
facility are briefly described .
  the instrumentation provided for
the wind-tunnel is described in some
detail, including the optical and other
methods of flow visualization used
in the tunnel .
  later parts will describe the
calibration of the flow in the
working-section, including temperature measurements .
a discussion of the heater
performance will also be included as
well as the results of tests to determine
starting and running pressure ratios,
blockage effects, model starting loads,
and humidity of the air flow .
