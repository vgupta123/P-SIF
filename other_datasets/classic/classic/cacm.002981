Subgoal Induction
A proof method, subgoal induction, is presented
as an alternative or supplement to the commonly 
used inductive assertion method.  Its major virtue is that
it can often be used to prove a loop's correctness 
directly from its input-output specification without the
use of an invariant.  The relation between subgoal 
induction and other commonly used induction rules is explored
and, in particular, it is shown that subgoal 
induction can be viewed as a specialized form of computation
induction.  A set of sufficient conditions 
are presented which guarantee that an input-output specification
is strong enough for the induction steps 
of a proof by subgoal induction to be valid.
