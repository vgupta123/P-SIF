Symbolic Notations for Statistical Tables
and an Approach Towards Automatic System Design
The preparation of statistical tables is an
important function of the data processing systems 
of some organizations, and a symbolic notation for the
description of tables has been shown to be a useful 
aid to documentation.  Such a notation also provides
the first step towards making automatic a tedious 
and time-consuming part of system design and programming
in many computer applications.  One notation 
is described and suggestions are made for the implementation of the larger goal.
