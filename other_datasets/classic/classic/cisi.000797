Progress in Documentation
  Classification is so fundamental and pervasive an activity that care
is needed to define its scope when discussing a particular application, such
as information retrieval.
  Retrieval from an information store (a 'library') of those items relevant
to a request involves locating a particular class (describing what we think
we want) and then, if necessary, adjusting this class - broadening it to find
more material or narrowing it if the initial response proves excessive.  This
implies recognition of the relations between the classes, and the whole
operation is often referred to neatly as 'locating and relating'.  Assuming
that we examine only a limited set of documents (those most likely to be
relevant) the operation is entirely one of classification - the recognition of
particular classes and their relations.  The fact that the instrument we use to
assist this operation may display quasi-classificatory features (e.g.,
alphabetical sequence) or may consist largely of our own brain box and memory
store should not hide this otherwise obvious fact.
