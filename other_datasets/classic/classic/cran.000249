formulae for the computation of the functions employed
for calculating the velocity distribution about a given
aerofoil .
  in order to determine the velocity distribution
about an arbitrary aerofoil, it is necessary to evaluate
the functions and (in the notation of aerofoil theory)
when is given numerically .  if the values of are specified
at 2n points equally spaced about the circle into which the
aerofoil is transformed, the formulae obtained here may be
used to calculate these functions at the same points .
formulae are also given for calculating the integrals of or,
since these have application to the design of aerofoils by
thwaites's numerical method .
  the simplicity of the formulae for and enables
the effect on the velocity distribution of a local change of shape
readily to be determined by making n large .  this is
discussed in 3 .
  the formulae are collected in the appendix, and a table
of the coefficients for the case n = 20 is given .
