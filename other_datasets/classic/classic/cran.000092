the analysis of redundant structures by the use of
high-speed digital computers .
  large-scale redundant structure analyses are currently
feasible by the use of modern high-speed digital computers .
this capability opportunely meets the urgent need to solve
complex problems which otherwise would be hopelessly beyond
the capacity of the hand desk computer .  however, the difficulties
have now shifted from tedious hand computations to the problems
of adequately representing the structure by a model and
of the peculiarities of irregular geometrical configurations .
  a wide scope of problem types can be handled by a generalized
program approach .  matrix formulation is used for the organization
of input data and for handling data transfer in the large
complex of subroutines, including the formation of equilibrium
and continuity conditions to the final loads and deflections .
simultaneous treatment of thermal expansions and plasticity
is included .
  the use of minimum-size redundant systems is emphasized,
starting from the philosophy of cutting members to provide a
statically determinate structure .  improved numerical accuracy
and problem size capacity is gained for a given computer .
examples are discussed ranging from simple plane-load diffusion
problems to pressurized fuselage cutouts and complex
wing-fuselage-shell intersection-type problems .
