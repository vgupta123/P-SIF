An Economic Analysis of Library Benefits
   Libraries find it increasingly necessary to use their limited resources in the
most efficient manner.. This requires the use of decision rules which permit 
library resources to be directed to those activities which yield the highest 
returns.. An effort is made to utilize part of welfare economics to suggest
which groups of library users will provide the greatest return to society..
   An evaluation of the traditional library functions of education, information,
and leisure suggests that libraries should direct their resources toward 
educational activities and not toward recreation when public monies are 
involved.. A case can be made for subsidizing the library activities of 
school-age children, other explicitly involved in education, disadvantages 
minority groups and governmental officials and staff..
   Since public and school libraries produce and distribute essentially the same
services, it is an uneconomic use of the communities' resources to maintain two
separate institutions, one of which imposes costs on the other as children are 
forced to use public library facilities due to school library inadequacies..
