Algorithms To Reveal Properties of Floating-Point Arithmetic
Two algorithms are presented in the form of
Fortran subroutines.  Each subroutine computes 
the radix and number of digits of the floating-point
numbers and whether rounding or chopping is done 
by the machine on which it is run.  The methods are
shown to work on any "reasonable" floating-point 
computer.
