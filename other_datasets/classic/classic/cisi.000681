II. Computer Generation of the Wiswesser Notation 
of Complex Polycyclic Structures
   A computer program has been written to generate the canonical Wiswesser
notation for complex polycyclic structures.. The program accepts as input the 
connection between all the ring atoms and then selects the path which conforms 
to the notation rules.. The operation of the program is described..
