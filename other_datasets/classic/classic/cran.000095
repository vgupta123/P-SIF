temperature distribution and thermal stresses in a

temperature distribution and thermal stresses in a
model of a supersonic wing .
  the transient temperature distribution and the thermal
stresses in an idealized wing structure considered by hoff and
torda in reference 1 are determined .  only the effects of
aerodynamic heating and of heat conduction are included,. radiation
and convection effects are neglected .  the present work differs
from that of reference 1 in that the conduction from the cap to
the web is considered when the temperature of the cap is
calculated, and the spar cap temperature is assumed to be a function
of both space and time .  graphs of temperature and thermal
stress distributions are presented, and the results are compared
with those of reference 1 .
