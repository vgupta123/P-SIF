pressure loads produced on a flat-plate wing by rocket jets exhausting
in a spanwise direction below the wing and perpendicular to a
free-stream flow of mach number 2.0 .
an investigation at a reynolds number per foot of 14.4 x 10 was made to
determine the pressure loads produced on a flat-plate wing by rocket
jets exhausting in a spanwise direction beneath the wing and
perpendicular to a free-stream flow of mach number 2.0 . the ranges of the
variables involved were /1/ nozzle types - one sonic /jet mach number of
two-dimensional supersonic /jet mach number of 1.71/,. /2/ vertical
nozzle positions beneath the wing of 4, 8, and 12 nozzle-throat
diameters,. and /3/ ratios of rocket-chamber total pressure to
free-stream static pressure from 0 to 130 .
the incremental normal force due to jet interference on the wing varied
from one to two times the rocket thrust and generally decreased as the
pressure ratio increased . the chordwise coordinate of the
incremental-normal-force center of pressure remained upstream of the nozzle center
line for the nozzle positions and pressure ratios of the investigation .
 the chordwise coordinate approached zero as the jet vertical distance
beneath the wing increased . in the spanwise direction there was little
change due to varying rocket-jet position and pressure ratio . some
boundary-layer flow separation on the wing was observed for the rocket
jets close to the wing and at the higher pressure ratios . the magnitude
 of the chordwise and spanwise pressure distributions due to jet
interference was greatest for rocket jets close to the wing and decreased as
the jet was displaced farther from the wing .
the design procedure for the rockets used is given in the appendix .
