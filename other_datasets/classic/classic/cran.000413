turbulent skin friction at high mach numbers and reynolds
numbers in air and helium . nasa r82, 1960 .
  results are given of local skin-friction measurements in turbulent
boundary layers over an equivalent air mach number range from 0.2 to 9.9
and an over-all reynolds number variation of 2x10 to 100x10 .  direct
force measurements were made by means of a floating element .  flows
were two-dimensional over a smooth flat surface with essentially zero
pressure gradient and with adiabatic conditions at the wall .  air and
helium were used as working fluids .  an equivalence parameter for
comparing boundary layers in different working fluids is derived and
the experimental verification of the parameter is demonstrated .
experimental results are compared with the results obtained by several
methods of calculating skin friction in the turbulent boundary layer .
