A Language Extension for Graph Processing and Its Formal Semantics
A simple programming language "extension,"
Graspe, for processing directed graphs is defined. 
 Graspe consists of a type of directed graph data structure
and a set of primitive operations for manipulating 
these structures.  Graspe may be most easily implemented
by embedding it in a host language.  Emphasis 
is placed both on Graspe itself and on its method of
definition.  Commonly, the definition of a language 
involves definition of the syntactic elements and explanation
of the meaning to be assigned them (the 
semantics).  The definition of Graspe here is solely in
terms of its semantics; that is, the data structures 
and operations are defined precisely but without assignment
of a particular syntactic representation. 
 Only when the language is implemented is assignment
of an explicit syntax necessary.  An example of 
an implementation of Graspe embedded in Lisp is given as
an illustration.  The advantages and disadvantages 
of the definition of a language in terms of its semantics are discussed.
