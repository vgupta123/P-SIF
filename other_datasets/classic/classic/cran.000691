calculation procedure for thermodynamic transport, and flow properties
of the combustion products of a hydrocarbon fuel mixture burned in air
with results for ethylene-air and methane-air mixtures .
a procedure is presented whereby the composition, thermodynamic
properties, and transport properties of the dissociated combustion
products of a fuel consisting of a mixed hydrocarbon compound burned in
air may be calculated . equations and procedures for determining
supersonic nozzle ordinates and flow properties for the dissociated
combustion products are presented in an appendix . results are presented
for the respective hydrocarbon fuels, methane and ethylene, at the
equivalence ratios of 1.0, 0.9, 0.8, and 0.7 for pressures varying
between 10 and 8 x 10 atmospheres and temperatures from 200degree k to
