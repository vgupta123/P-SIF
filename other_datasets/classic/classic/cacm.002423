A Parser-Generating System for Constructing Compressed Compilers
This paper describes a parser-generating system
(PGS) currently in use on the CDC-6500 computer 
at Purdue University.  The PGS is a Fortran-coded compiler.
 In the input translation grammar, each BNF 
syntactic rule corresponds to a (possibly empty) "code
generator" realizable as an assembly language, 
Fortran or Algol, subroutine that is called whenever
that syntactic rule is applied in the parse of a 
program.  Typical one-pass compilers constructed by the
PGS translate source programs at speeds approaching 
14,000 cards per minute.  For an XPL compiler, the parser
program and its tables currently occupy 288 
words of 60-bit core memory of which 140 words are parsing
table entries and 82 words are links to code 
generators.
