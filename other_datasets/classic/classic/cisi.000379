Sources of Information on Specific Subjects
  An alternative hypothesis to
be investigated is that, to a considerable extent, the
references are scattered throughout all periodicals
with a frequency approximately related inversely
to the scope.  On this hypothesis, the aggregate of
periodicals can be divided into classes according to
relevance of scope to the subject concerned, but the
more remote classes will, in the aggregate, produce
as many references as the more related classes.  The
whole range of periodicals thus acts as a family of
successive generations of diminishing kinship, each
generation being greater in number than the
preceding, and each constituent of a generation 
producing inversely according to its degree of
remoteness. 
  The investigation covered, in the first place, the
references quoted, in the course of four and two and
a-half years respectively, by the current bibliographies
of Applied Geophysics and Lubrication, which are 
prepared in the library.  The source of each
reference being given, it was possible to arrange the
sources in order of productivity, the results being
set down in columns A and B of the table, in the
previous column.
