application of similar solutions to calculations of
laminar heat transfer on bodies with yaw and large
pressure gradients in high speed flow .
  an integral method for the rapid calculation of heat-transfer
distributions on yawed cylinders of arbitrary cross-sectional shape
and on bodies of revolution in high-speed flows is developed for
laminar boundary layers .  the method involves the quadrature of a
function of the pressure distribution (assumed given) and satisfies
the integral energy equation with the assumption of local similarity,
wherein the actual boundary-layer profiles at every station are
replaced by corresponding profiles from a family of similar solutions .
  the method is compared with other local similarity methods and
with experimental heat-transfer data on a circular cylinder and on a
body of revolution designed for large axial pressure gradients .  good
agreement between theory and data is obtained and it is shown that the
present integral method, in both its complete and simplified form, gives
generally better agreement with the data than certain other local
similarity methods .
  numerical examples are presented showing that the effect of sweep
and gas properties on heat-transfer distribution is small .
