A Definition of Relevance for Information Retrieval
   The concept of "relevance", sometimes also called "pertinence" or 
"aboutness", is central to the theory of information retrieval.. Unfortunately,
however, there is at present no consensus as to how this notion should be 
defined.. The purpose of this paper is to propose and defend a definition of
what it means to say that a piece of stored information is "relevant" to the
information need of a retrieval system user..
   The suggested definition explicates relevance in terms of logical 
implication.. For one yes-or-no question answering system which operates with
one of the standard formalized languages, the definition provides a 
mathematically precise criterion of relevance.. For other types of fact 
retrieval systems and reference retrieval systems, including all systems whose 
stored information is expressed in natural language, the definition is not  
mathematically precise but is nevertheless still helpful on a conceptual 
level..
