quasi-cylindrical surfaces with prescribed loadings
in the linearised theory of supersonic flow .
  a formula for the velocity field in terms of a given surface
distribution of vorticity is applied to points
lying on the surface .  an equation
giving the shape of a quasi
circular-cylindrical surface in terms of a
prescribed loading is derived .  as an
example a half ring wing with prescribed
loading is discussed .
