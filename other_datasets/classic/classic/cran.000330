taylor instability of finite surface waves .
taylor instability of finite surface waves .
the instability of the accelerated interface
between a liquid (methanol or carbon
tetrachloride) and air has been investigated
experimentally for approximate
sinusoidal disturbances of wave-number range
from well below to well above the
cut-off .  the growth rates are measured and
compared with theoretical results .
a third-order theory shows the phenomena
of overstability which is found in the
experimental results .  some measurements
of later stages of growth agree
moderately well with the available theory
and disclose some additional
phenomena of bubble competition, helmholtz
instability with transition to turbulence,
and jet instability with production of drops .
