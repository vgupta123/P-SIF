the problem of resistance in compressible fluids .
  this report is restricted to the
resistance of bodies of revolution and
of cylindrical bodies of infinite length
moving with uniform velocity in
a compressible fluid .  in the case of bodies
of revolution it will be assumed
that the direction of the movement is
parallel to the axis of symmetry .
it will be assumed that the fluid satisfies
the equation of state of perfect
gases, i. e. const., where p denotes
the pressure, the density and
t the absolute temperature .  in addition
to obeying this equation the
fluid is characterized by the statement
that the intrinsic energy of the
unit mass amounts to where for
simplicity's sake the specific heat
will be expressed in work rather
than heat units .  the ratio between
the specific heat at constant pressure
and the specific heat at constant
volume will be denoted by .  it is
known that the value of x depends
upon the number of degrees of freedom
of the molecules,. if this number
is denoted by n .  for air
the value x = 1.4 will be used .
the limiting case x = 1 will
be referred to as that of a
assumed that in the range
considered and are independent of
the temperature .
