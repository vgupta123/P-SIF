hypersonic viscous flow over a flat plate .
     in dealing with the steady laminar viscous flow over a
semi-infinite flat plate some of the following topics are discussed .
the streamline in the boundary layer over a leading edge of given
thickness . the rate of growth of the boundary layer in the main stream, and
causes of pressure variations .
asymptotic solutions for thn downstream flow region, including the
joining interaction of shock waves at the leading edge .
pressure variations in the interanl viscous flow layer and in external
inviscid flow considered as prandtl meyer flow . in cases of streamline
deflection, the free stream mach number, zero pressure gradient, and
surface pressure distribution . asymptotic solutions for cases of
fluid injection of a cool gas . prandtl heat transfer . the joining
interaction between the external inviscid flow and the internal viscous
flow layer . steady laminar hpyersonic viscous flow over a flat wedge
and a cone .
