the application of lighthill formula for numerical
calculation of pressure distributions on bodies of
revolution at supersonic speed and zero angle of attack .
an integral expression, given by lighthill and based
on linearized theory, for the external
supersonic flow over the surface of slender pointed
or ducted bodies of revolution at zero
angle of attack is shown to give a good approximation
of the exact flow for a much wider mach
number and thickness range than could be expected from
linearized theory .  a numerical method,
based on this expression, is developed and applied for
digital computing .  some results from
applying the digital computing procedure for determining
the pressure distribution and wave
drag for various bodies of revolution are given .
