Libraries and Librarianship in the West: A Brief History
  This book was written in an attempt to fill a gap.  If one ignored the major
historical resources in other languages (which few United States students read),
notably the Handbuch der Bibliothekswissenschaft, edited by Fritz Milkau and
others (2d ed., Leipzig: Harrassowitz, 1952-1957; Registerband, 1965), it was
plain that the goodly company of works available did not meet all fundamental
needs.  The most nearly comprehensive treatment was Elmer C. Johnson's A
History of Libraries in the Western World (Scarecrow, 1965), which remains in
its second edition (Scarecrow, 1970) solid and attractive reading but continues
as announced to cover only libraries.  Its attention to librarianship is very
limited; numerous important theorists are not even mentioned.  Furthermore,
the predominant organization by type of library hampers the analysis of
crosscurrents between libraries and life and thought, particularly the
development of the image of the library and librarian.  The aim here has been
to tie it all together.
  In the present offering, "the West" is used conventionally: European 
civilization, with its Near Eastern ancestors and its Western Hemisphere
progeny.  The limitation is practical.  To try to "cover" even the West may
prove to be too much for one person; to go beyond would be rash.  Yet an
understanding of those lands "beyond" would be most valuable to us all.
Let us hope that someone will try to provide it.
