effect of quasi-steady air forces on incompressible
bending-torsion flutter .
  explicit solutions are obtained for the bending-torsion flutter
of a two-dimensional airfoil in incompressible flow under the
assumptions that the theodorsen function, c(k) is set equal to a
real constant, and the diagonal virtual mass terms are negligible .
for the case of small bending to torsion frequency ratio, a
comparison is made of these quasi-steady solutions with an
earlier empirical expression suggested by theodorsen and garrick
for the nonsteady case, and the effect of the c(k) function is
indicated .  the importance of the c.g. location for these small
cases is re-emphasized, and the possibility of flutter at zero
air speed is indicated .
