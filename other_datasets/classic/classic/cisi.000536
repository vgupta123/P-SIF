Information Theory and Reliable Communication
  This book is designed primarily for use as a first-year graduate text in
information theory, suitable for both engineers and mathematicians.  It is
assumed that the reader has some understanding of freshman calculus and
elementary probability, and in the later chapters some introductory random
process theory.  Unfortunately there is one more requirement that is harder
to meet.  The reader must have a reasonable level of mathematical maturity
and capability for abstract thought.  The major results of the theory are
quite subtle and abstract and must sometimes be arrived at by what appears to
be rather devious routes.  Fortunately, recent simplifications in the theory
have made the major results more accessible than in the past.
