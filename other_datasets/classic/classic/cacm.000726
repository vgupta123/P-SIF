A General Program for the Analysis of
Square and Rectangular Lattice Designs
This paper describes a general-purpose program
that will handle those incomplete block designs 
known as square and rectangular lattices.  Flow diagrams
are given so that the method of calculation 
may be programmed for any digital computer.
