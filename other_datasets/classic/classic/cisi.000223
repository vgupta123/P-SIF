Document Delivery Capabilities of Major Biomedical Libraries in 1968:
Results of a National Survey Employing Standardized Tests
   The standardized Document Delivery Tests (DDT's) developed earlier (Bulletin
56: 241-267, July 1968) were employed to assess the capability of ninety-two
medical school libraries for meeting the document needs of biomedical 
researchers, and the capability of fifteen major resource libraries for filling 
I-L requests from biomedical libraries.. The primary test data are summarized 
as statistics on the observed availability status of the 300 plus documents in
the test samples, and as measures expressing capability as a function of the 
mean time that would be required for users to obtain test sample documents..
A mathematical model is developed in which the virtual capability of a library,
as seen by its users, equals the algebraic sum of the basic capability afforded
by its holdings; the combined losses attributable to use of its collection, 
processing, relative inaccessibility, and housekeeping problems; and the gain
realized by coupling with other resources (I-L borrowing).. For a particular 
library, or group of libraries, empirical values for each of these variables 
can be  calculated easily from the capability measures and the status 
statistics.. Regression equations are derived that provide useful predictions 
of basic capability from collection size.. The most important result of this 
work is that cost-effectiveness analyses can now be used as practical decision 
aids in managing a basic library service.. A program of periodic surveys and 
further development of DDT's is recommended as appropriate for the Medical 
Library Association..
