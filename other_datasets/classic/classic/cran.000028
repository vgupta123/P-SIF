a note on the explosion solution of sedov with application
to the newtonian theory of unsteady hypersonic flow .
an exact analytical solution of the equations of inviscid
compressible unsteady flow has been given by sedov (reference
to the solution may be made through hayes and probstein) .
this solution is the similarity solution for a constant-energy point
explosion .  in view of the recent work on problems of hypersonic
flow in the limiting form of the ratio of specific heats near 1
solution in this limit and inquire what form such a solution would
take .  einbinder, in a recent note, has examined the solution for
various but does not mention the interesting case of .
it may be shown that the convergence to the limit is nonuniform
over the flow field .  it is also not difficult to show that the non-
uniform behavior exhibited here is that which one would expect
from the newtonian formulation as derived in reference 3 .
