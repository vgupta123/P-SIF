List Tracing in Systems Allowing Multiple Cell-Types
List-processing systems have each allowed the
use of only a single size and configuration of 
list cell.  In this paper a system is described which
allows the use of arbitrarily many different sizes 
and configurations of list cells, possibly not specified until run time.
