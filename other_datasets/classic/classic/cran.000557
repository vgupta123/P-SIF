  this note refers to paper of same title by feldman in ars j. 30,
validity of blast wave theory cannot be justified on rational or
theoretical grounds because of different values of energy in cross
flow field as calculated by this theory and by method of
characteristics .  present note questions this conclusion, shows reasonably
good agreement when energy is calculated for points where shock
location, streamline pattern, and velocity, temperature, and
pressure profiles are adequately defined, and still better agreement
when energy is calculated from flow quantities provided by-
characteristics method .  results are checked using data from
independent source .  conclusion is reached that blast wave theory is
still valid .
