note on creep buckling of columns .
  some general topics in elastic stability are discussed .  in
particular, attention is given to the relationship between
adjacent-equilibrium-position and energy techniques, to the effects of
nonlinearity, and to the sensitivity of certain stability problems to the
character of the loading .
