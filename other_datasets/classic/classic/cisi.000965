The Information Needs of Current Scientific Research
       The information demands, or information needs, of current scientific
research are similar in many respects to the information needs in
other forms of scholarship.  But this is not true in all cases, and the focus 
of this paper is on the needs of the research scientists.  In discussing the
information needs of the scientist, I shall not limit myself to those for
which library work is immediately relevant; in fact, a good part of this
paper will call attention to the importance of those aspects of scientific
communication that take place outside libraries and, indeed, outside 
literature. (There are, of course, very few aspects of scientific communication 
to which library work is not at least indirectly relevant.)
