Morphology of "Information Flow"
  Such phrases as "information flow" may be purely metaphorical, or may refer to
porterage and storage of physical documents, transmission of signals, power
required for signaling, Shannon's Selective Information, changes in the state of
one's personal knowledge, propagation of announcements concerning messages, 
social increase of awareness, propagation of or reaction to imperatives, and so
on.  These matters are distinct and must be distinguished.  Then conditions must
be stated under which one can validly speak of and measure the appropriate flow.
In this paper it is shown that within the field of Notification (mention and
delivery of recorded messages to users) there are twenty basic activities formed
by choosing triads from the six variables, Message, Code, Channel, Source,
Destination, and Designation.
  "Flow" has meaning only when two such triads have two variables in common,
forming a tetrad.  Then flow or correspondence between any pair of variables is
inextricable from a conjugate flow or correspondence between the other pair.
Between any pair of endpoints there are six possibly distinct types of flow,
according to which two of the remaining four variables are directly used to
achieve the flow.
