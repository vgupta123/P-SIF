Multiple Precision Floating-Point Conversion
from Decimal-to-Binary and Vice Versa
Decimal-to-binary and binary-to-decimal floating-point
conversion is often performed by using 
a table of the powers 10^i, (ia positive integer) for
converting from base 10 to base 2, and by using 
a table of the coefficient of a polynomial approximation
of 10^x, (0<=x<1) for converting from base 2 
to base 10.  These tables occupy a large storage region
in the case of a nonsingle precision conversion. 
 This paper shows that a single small table suffices
for a floating-point conversion from decimal to 
binary, and vice versa, in any useful precision.
