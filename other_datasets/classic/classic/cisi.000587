Obsolescence of Special Library Periodicals: Sampling Errors and
Utility Contours
   Problems arising in the measurement of the rates of obsolescence of the sets
of periodicals taken by special libraries are discussed.. The relatively large
errors that arise in sampling the negative exponential distribution are 
analyzed because they may account for some of the discrepancies reported and
because they indicate the need for firmer statistical control of work on
obsolescence than has yet been generally appreciated..
   When the rate of decline has been satisfactorily established there still
remains the problem of deciding how to apply it.. Issues of those periodicals
that contribute most productively should be retained for a longer period than
those of periodicals that contribute less.. To solve this problem the concept
of "utility contours" is introduced and exemplified in the design of a p%
library..
   It is argued that no discarding policy is likely to be generally applicable; 
every special library must be regarded as a special case.  Rather than suggest
new measurements, therefore, the paper offers simple graphical techniques that
are applicable to any other special case..
