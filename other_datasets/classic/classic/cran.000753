development of a quasi-steady approach to flutter and
correlation with kernel-function results .
  the quasi-steady approach to flutter utilizes experimental or
theoretical steady-state aerodynamic data to arrive at increased
understanding of the flutter mechanism, and also, in many cases,
acceptably accurate quantitative flutter predictions .
circulation lag effects are neglected, but aerodynamic damping is
included in the evaluation of the air forces .  situations requiring
the inclusion of rate aerodynamics for accurate flutter estimation
are specified .
  a quasi-unsteady approach is also discussed, in which the
approximate magnitude of the circulation lag function at flutter
is included in simple modifications of quasi-steady parameters .
  closed-form solutions are derived for the flutter characteristics
of a typical section with and without rate aerodynamics .
application is then made to the rational flutter analysis of
three-dimensional multi-degree-of-freedom lifting surfaces .
  a specific planform is evaluated in the mach-number range
from zero to two .  quasi-steady, quasi-unsteady, and
kernel-function results are compared subsonically .  quasi-steady
results are utilized supersonically .
  primary applications of the quasi-steady approach are in the
areas of preliminary design and parameter-variation studies,
modification of more sophisticated flutter theories to force
compatibility with available steady-state data, and flutter evaluation
of complex configurations which can be rationally analyzed by
steady-state aerodynamic theories, but for which no complete
unsteady aerodynamic theories are presently available .
