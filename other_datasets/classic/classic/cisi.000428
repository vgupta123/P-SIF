Analysis of Some Portfolio Selection Models for R&D
   This paper presents the analytical review of mathematical programming models
that have been proposed as aids to the related problems of resources allocation 
and project selection in R&D.. The models are classified according to whether
they are based on linear, integer, chance constrained, or dynamic programming..
Representative examples from these classes are described and evaluated in 
detail.. The evaluation is on terms of data requirements; built-in assumptions;
ease of computation; usefulness of outputs; versatility of application..
