dreaming sleep in autistic twins
each of 5-year-old identical autistic twins
was observed during one spontaneous all
night sleep session during which their
electroencephalogram, eye movement, heart
rate, and chin muscle potential were recorded.
these autistic twins showed a similar
patterning and amount of dreaming sleep to
each other and to that reported for normal
children of the same age.
