An Algorithm for Minimizing Backboard Wiring Functions
A partially exhaustive algorithm is presented
for solving the following problem arising from 
automatic layout of a computer.  Given an ordered set
E1, E2,..., EN of N computer components, for each 
permutation of the elements E1, E2.., EN, there is attached
a value of an integer function F.  The algorithm 
finds a local minimum of F by evaluating the set {Delta
F} of the increments corresponding to a certain 
set of exchanges of two elements.Then the exchange
corresponding to the least negative increment of 
{Delta F} is performed.  The process is iterated and stopped
when the set of the increments is a positive 
or empty set, which, it is proved, corresponds to a
minimum.  The procedure is similar to the Downhill 
Method for finding the minimum of a real function F(P),
and can be applied to other placement problems. 
 Experimental results are presented with backboards formed
by many elements and different initial placements.
