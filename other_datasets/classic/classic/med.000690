the antidiuretic effect of thiazides is thus the
result of the induced sodium deficit.  the fall in
serum osmolality may be contributory by
reducing thirst.  as depletion of body sodium will
be self-limiting the major hazard to the use of
thiazides is potassium depletion.  treatment of
patients with vasopressin insufficiency type of
diabetes insipidus with thiazides is only indicated
for those who are intolerant of hormone replace-
ment.  in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus thiazides
have a more important therapeutic application.
