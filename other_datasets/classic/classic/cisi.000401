Future Shock
  This is a book about what happens to people when they are
overwhelmed by change.  It is about the ways in which we adapt
- or fail to adapt - to the future.
  Much has been written about the future.  Yet, for the most
part, books about the world to come sound a harsh metallic note.
These pages, by contrast, concern themselves with the "soft" or
human side of tomorrow.  Moreover, they concern themselves
with the steps by which we are likely to reach tomorrow. They
deal with common, everyday matters - the products we buy and
discard, the places we leave behind, the corporations we inhabit,
the people who pass at an ever faster clip through our lives.  The
future of friendship and family life in probed.  Strange new
subcultures and life styles are investigated, along with an array of
other subjects from politics and playgrounds to skydiving and sex.
