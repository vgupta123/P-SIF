Toward a Discipline of Real-Time Programming
Programming is divided into three major categories
with increasing complexity of reasoning 
in program validation: sequential programming, multiprogramming,
and real-time programming.  By adhering 
to a strict programming discipline and by using a suitable
high-level language molded after this discipline, 
the complexity of reasoning about concurrency and execution
time constrain ts may be drastically reduced. 
 This may be the only practical way to make real-time
systems analytically verifiable and ultimately 
reliable.  A possible discipline is outlined and
expressed in terms of the language Modula.
