A Graphic Catalog Card Index
   To improve accessibility and maintenance of art slides in the United States
Military Academy Library at West Point, a model card with a graphic image of 
the slide was designed with pertinent identifying information displayed 
directly above a black-and-white opaque photo and also key-punched into it.. 
The card serves for ample comparison reference previous to handling the slides
and can produce a subject-arranged permuted index in book form.. The later 
permits access from the approach of form, geographic area, name, time of 
origin, artist, school, or style, etc.. Some added advantages, common to other 
kinds of graphic collections, are detailed.. Estimated costs of 
photo-reproduction of original cards, various kinds of copies, and computer 
time and materials are listed.. Future benefits from a consistent, unified 
cataloging system for graphic objects and the dissemination of this kind of 
information in a network structure are indicated as major goals..
