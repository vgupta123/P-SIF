Variable-Precision Exponentiation
A previous paper presented an efficient algorithm,
called the Recomputation Algorithm, for 
evaluating a rational expression to within any desired tolerance
on a computer which performs variable-precision 
arithmetic operations.  The Recomputation Algorithm can be
applied to expressions involving any variable-precision 
operations having O(10^(-p) + SUM{|Ei|}) error bounds,
where p denotes the operation's precision and 
Ei denotes the error in the operation's ith argument.
 This paper presents an efficient variable-precision 
exponential operation with an error bound of the above
order.  Other operations such as log, sin, and 
cos, which have simple series expansions, can be handled similarly.
