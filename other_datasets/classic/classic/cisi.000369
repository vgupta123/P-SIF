Economics of Defense in the Nuclear Age
  The purpose of this book is to explain a way of looking at military
problems which we and others with whom we have been associated have
found fruitful in insights and productive of solutions.  Essentially we
regard all military problems as, in one of their aspects, economic
problems in the efficient allocation and use of resources.  We believe
that this way of looking at military problems goes far toward reconciling
the apparent conflict of views between the officers and officials who are
responsible for defense and the officials and Congressmen whose primary
interest is economy - except in determining the over-all size of the
military budget, where conflict between these points of view is inevitable.
