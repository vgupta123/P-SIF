Multiprocessing Compactifying Garbage Collection
Algorithms for a multiprocessing compactifying
garbage collector are presented and discussed. 
 The simple case of two processors, one performing LISP-like
list operations and the other performing 
garbage collection continuously, is thoroughly examined.
The necessary capabilities of each processor 
are defined, as well as interprocessor communication
and interlocks. Complete procedures for garbage 
collection and for standard list processing primitives
are presented and thoroughly explained.  Particular 
attention is given to the problems of marking and relocating
list cells while another processor may be 
operating on them.  The primary aim throughout is to
allow the list processor to run unimpeded while 
the other processor reclaims list storage.  The more
complex cases involving several list processors 
and one or more garbage collection processors are also briefly discussed.
