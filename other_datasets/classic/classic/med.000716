hydrocephalus
any present day definition of
hydrocephalus is very loose.  the
authors would rather adopt the
concept that hydrocephalus is an
abnormal condition characterized
by excessive amount of cerebrospi-
nal fluid with or without enlarge-
ment of the head.
the most common cause of
hydrocephalus is arachnoiditis fol-
lowed by congenital anomalies.  a
neoplasm is a rare cause.
the ideal surgical procedure
is the placement of a ventriculo-
atrial shunt, using either pudenz
or halter valves.  where these
valves cannot be availed of the
choice is between a conservative
waiting with medical support and
ventricular tapping from the older
surgical shunting procedures, like,
ventriculo-peritoneal, choroidoplex-
ectomy, thecal-fimbia, subarach-
noid-ureteral, and others.
