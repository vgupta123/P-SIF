Bibliographic Coupling Between Scientific Papers
This report describes the results of automatic processing
of a large number of scientific papers according
to a rigorously defined criterion of coupling.  The
population of papers under study was ordered into 
groups that satisfy the stated criterion of interrelation.
An examination of the papers that constitute the
groups shows a high degree of logical correlation.
