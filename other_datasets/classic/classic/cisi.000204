this analysis of circulation in the Yale Medical Library.. Full-time teacher
faculty are the heaviest users of journal literature, and  students, of
monograph literature.. Faculties of Medical School departments are compared in
terms of their use of material in individual subjects.. Subject literatures are
analyzed in terms of groups of users borrowing from them.. The extent to which
journal titles used by medical students  are also used by Medical School
faculty is examined.. One of the products of the study is a rank list of 
journal titles used in the Library.. Results are presented in several tables..
