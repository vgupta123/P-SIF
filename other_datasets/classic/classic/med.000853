a genetic study of neonatal obstructive jaundice
58 children with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 7 with intrahepatic
biliary atresia and 50 with 'neonatal hepatitis' were analysed
concerning diagnostic criteria, natural history, familial, clinical
and pathological data.  in extrahepatic biliary atresia, there is no
evidence of a familial tendency, influence of maternal age, birth
order or disturbance of foetal development.  in 'neonatal hepatitis',
there were 4 consanguineous parents, suggesting a mutant
autosomal gene in homozygous form.  some infants with the genotype
for 'neonatal hepatitis' may manifest a very mild or a very severe
form, so, a diagnosis was not made.  an apparent excess of males
over females may be another evidence of failure of manifestation of
the genotype.  but 'neonatal hepatitis' may be a manifestation of
more than one disease.  in 'neonatal hepatitis' the birth weight
shows a marked decrease, perhaps as a sequence of disturbed liver
function in the foetus.
