on the concept of stability of inelastic systems .
  simple models are employed to bring out the large and
important differences between buckling in the plastic range and
classical elastic instability .  static and kinetic criteria are
compared and their interrelation discussed .  nonlinear behavior in
particular is often found to be the key to the physically valid
solution .  the nonconservative nature of plastic deformation in
itself or in combination with the nonlinearity requires concepts
not found in classical approaches .  conversely, the classical
linearized condition of neutral equilibrium is really not relevant
in inelastic buckling .  plastic buckling loads are not uniquely
defined but cover a range of values and are often more properly
thought of as maximum loads for some reasonable initial
imperfection in geometry or dynamic disturbance .
  the models indicate that basically the same information is
obtained from essentially static systems by assuming initial
imperfection in geometric forms as by assuming dynamic
disturbances .  one approach complements the other and both are
helpful in obtaining an understanding of the physical phenomena .
