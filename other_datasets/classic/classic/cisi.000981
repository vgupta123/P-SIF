Statistics of Collection Overlap at the Libraries of the Six New
England State Universities
  As part of a design study to specify a regional processing
center for the New England state university libraries, it was
required to know the percentage of collection overlap with respect to
each of the 30 ordered pairs of 6 libraries.  Participating states were
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
Connecticut.  This overlap data was needed to predict the degree of
joint use of cataloging information and to estimate the efficiency of
collective reclassification.
  The results revealed a high degree of commonality in the 6 collections,
showing, for example, that a random title from one library had 
a 40% chance of being present in another randomly selected library.
When current imprint samples were tested, the figure rose to 47%.
Rhode Island's holdings were shown to be the collection of greatest
duplication elsewhere.
