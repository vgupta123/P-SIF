Characteristics of the FORTRAN CEP Language
The FORTRAN CEP languages differs from FORTRAN
II mainly because: (1) it extends the variety 
of the modes for real quantities; (2) it allows suitable
mixtures, in an input/output list or in an expression, 
of quantities that occur under different modes; (3)
it makes it possible to address a greater number 
of input/output equipment; and (4) it removes the restrictions
on the complexity of the list of quantities 
to be transmitted between the magnetic core memory
and the drum or the magnetic tape units.
