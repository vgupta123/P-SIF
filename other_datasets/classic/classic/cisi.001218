Principles of Numerical Taxonomy
  It is the purpose of this book to present a firm theoretical basis for
numerical taxonomy, to show why we believe numerical taxonomy has
advantages over conventionally practiced taxonomy, to report on the
previous advances made in the field so far, and to furnish newcomers in
the field with a detailed step-by-step description of the procedures
employed in numerical taxonomy.
