note on creep buckling of columns .
it appears from librove's interesting analysis that, for
the case of creep buckling of columns, the initial
imperfections contained in ordinary columns provide the mechanism by
which failure due to creep occurs after a period of time .  in fact,
it can be concluded from this analysis that a theoretically perfect
column that is initially loaded below the time-independent critical
load will not buckle at all .  this is an interesting contrast to the
case of static buckling where small initial imperfections play an
insignificant role, since the failing load of an initially imperfect
column is substantially the same as that of a theoretically perfect
column .  it is of interest, therefore, to conjecture whether there is
any possible mechanism by which a column containing no initial
imperfections can fail as a result of creep when the initial load is
less than the theoretical buckling load .
