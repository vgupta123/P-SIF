Farewell to Alexandria 
Solution to space, growth, and performance problems of libraries
  The publication of this collection of essays opens a new era for
libraries, taking the first departure in 2,300 years from that durable
model conceived by the librarians of Alexandria and endlessly replicated
by every succeeding generation of librarians, right down to the present
day.  The Alexandrian model persists through the unexamined faith
that to be good a library must be vast and always growing.  The papers
presented here examine that faith scientifically, demonstrate that it
rests on nothing more solid than mistaken intuition, and consign it to
the limbo of outworn dogmas.
