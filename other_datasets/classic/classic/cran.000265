some instabilities arising from the interaction between
shock waves and boundary layer .
  a brief review is made of the available information concerning
the flow fluctuations and instabilities arising from shock-induced
separation in the flow over aerofoils and wings .  the influence this
phenomenon has on the oscillatory behaviour of aerofoils and control
surfaces is also briefly discussed .
  a more detailed consideration is devoted to a recent investigation
at the n.p.l. into the part played by shock-induced separation in the
instability of a control surface .
