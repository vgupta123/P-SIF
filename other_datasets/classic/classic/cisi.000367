Economics of Book Storage
  This report attempts to present and interpret current
(Winter 1968-69) information on the economics of book storage
in relation to the other factors a university administrator
must consider in developing a program for housing an
ever-growing book collection when there are present or
future limitations on space and money.
  The study will attempt to answer two specific questions:
1) Is it economical for colleges and universities to select
so-called little-used books from the regular bookstacks and
store them elsewhere? 2) Is the cost factor the only one a
university need consider in adopting a storage program; and,
if not, how is cost related to the others?
  The facts and conclusions in this report are based on
the library book storage situation as of 1969.  Innovations
in computer applications and other technologies could
presumably change the nature of some of the cost factors, but
it is the author's opinion that these changes unlikely to
occur within the next 5 to 10 years.
