The Historical Background of Departmental and Collegiate Libraries
  In spite of the great volume of material dealing with
departmental and collegiate libraries that has appeared in
library periodicals and books on university and college
library administration, there has been relatively little original
thought on the subject and virtually no historical treatment to
provide an adequate background for solution of problems which
have their roots in a former generation.  Most of the literature
has been either repetition of the old arguments for and against
this type of library organization or statements of how this or
that institution has faced its peculiar problems.  Except for
contemporary accounts of early American scholars describing the
attempts to transplant the German seminar library to American
soil and reports on a few large university libraries, there is no
account of the conditions which brought about and for many
years invigorated the departmental system.  An evaluation of
trends in the history of departmental libraries over the last
three-quarters of a century should prove to be a valuable supplement
to other information in the hands of surveyors and administrators
who are interested in abolishing, establishing, continuing, or
amalgamating departmental libraries in a given institution.
