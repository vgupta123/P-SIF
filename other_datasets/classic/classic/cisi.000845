A Personalized Service to Academic Researchers:
the Experimental Information Service in the Social
Sciences at the University of Bath
  Between 1969 and 1971 Bath University Library experimented with a personalized
information service to social science researchers at the Universities of Bath
and Bristol.  The principal service offered was a manual current awareness 
service, based mainly on the scanning of primary and abstracting journals.
The service was evaluated by feedback slips returned by clients for each
reference notified, and by a questionnaire at the end of the experiment. The
relevance performance was good, and few references had been seen before; some
precision could have been sacrificed to ensure comprehensive recall.  The whole
service was rated highly by nearly all users and considered to be a high 
priority among the various possible claims on university resources.  Those
who had the closest contact with the information officers had the best
scores on most aspects evaluated and rated the service most highly.  Some
general observations on the place and value of an information service in a
university library are given in conclusion.
