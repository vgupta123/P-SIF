summary of laminar boundary layer solutions for
wedge-type flow over convection and transpiration cooled
surfaces .
  a summary of exact solutions of the
laminar-boundary-layer equations
for wedge-type flow, useful in estimating
heat transfer to such
arbitrarily shaped bodies as turbine blades,
is presented .  the solutions are
determined for small mach numbers and
a prandtl number at the wall of 0.7 ,.
ranges of mainstream pressure gradients
and rates of coolant flow through
a porous wall are considered for the
following cases ..  (1) small
temperature changes in the boundary layer
along a constant- and along a
variable-temperature wall, and (2) large
temperature changes in the boundary layer
along a constant-temperature wall .
  dimensionless forms of heat-transfer
and friction parameters and
boundary-layer thicknesses are tabulated .
the results indicate that
coolant emission and increased stream-to-wall
temperature ratios diminished
the friction and heat transfer for a
constant wall temperature .  for a
variable wall temperature with small
temperature differences in the
boundary layer, the friction was unaffected,
but the heat transfer was greatly
increased for increased wall-temperature
gradient .  heat-transfer results
in the literature reveal that transpiration
cooling is much more effective
for prandtl numbers of the order of 5.0 than for 0.7 .
