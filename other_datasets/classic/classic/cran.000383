integration of the boundary layer equations for a plane in compressible
flow with heat transfer .
the equations of motion of compressible viscous flow with vanishing
pressure gradient past a plane are integrated in semi-convergent
expressions, for the case when the physical constants depend on
temperature and the prandtl number is close to unity .
simple expressions are obtained for the temperature and velocity
distributions in the boundary layer, the drag coefficient, and their
dependence on the physical constants,.they contain the well-known results
and several new ones .
for the case when the temperature of the boundary is either above, or
not much below, the temperature of the main flow, the results obtained
closely agree with crocco's numerical computations .
