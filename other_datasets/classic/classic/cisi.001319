Scientific and Technological Communication
  My objective in this work has been to try to get at the fundamental
aspects of the elements and media of scientific and technological
communication and to describe the critical issues involving them as well
as the opportunities and techniques for exploiting them which hopefully
could aid both the "users" and the "handlers" of these important resources.
