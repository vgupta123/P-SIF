heat transfer in planetary atmospheres at super-satellite speeds .
heat transfer in planetary atmospheres at super-satellite speeds .
the main purpose of this investigation is to examine the dependence of
heat transfer in planetary atmospheres on the total enthalpy up to
flight velocities of 50,000 ft/sec where a large proportion of the atoms
 are ionized . the /total thermodynamic and transport property/ concept
discussed by hirshfelder /j.chem.phys.,26/2/,feb.,1957/ is used .
