Computerized Drug Information services
   To compare computerized services in chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and 
clinical medicine of pharmaceutical interest, equivalent profiles were run on 
magnetic tape files of CA-Condensates, CBAC, Excerpta Medica, MEDLARS and
Ringdoc.. The results of these searches, which covered individual chemical 
compounds used in pharmacology and medicine, are tabulated overlap of services,
relative speed of citing references, and unique areas of journal coverage..
