Proof Techniques for Hierarchically Structured Programs
A method for describing and structuring programs
that simplifies proofs of their correctness 
is presented.  The method formally represents a program
in terms of levels of abstraction, each level 
of which can be described by a self-contained nonprocedural
specification.  The proofs, like the programs, 
are structured by levels.  Although only manual proofs
are described in the paper, the method is also 
applicable to semi-automatic and automatic proofs.  Preliminary
results are encouraging, indicating that 
the method can be applied to large programs, such as operating systems.
