carcinoma of the middle ear
the results of radiotherapy in a relatively large
number of cases of carcinoma of the middle ear
are reported.  the crude 5 year survival rate of 100
cases is 29%.  there is no difference in survival
between those cases who had a preliminary
mastoidectomy and those who did not.  the use of
megavoltage x-rays probably increases the survival
rate.
