Electronic Data Processing in the University Library
    Following five years of experience with the mechanization
of procedures using data processing equipment, the university
library in Bochum is attempting to summarize its findings.
A comparison with earlier publications about the use of
electronic data processing equipment shows in what measure
the original plans have actually been affected by the
experience that has been gained.  This summary also serves
as a report for the wider public that may be interested in
technical questions of library processing.
