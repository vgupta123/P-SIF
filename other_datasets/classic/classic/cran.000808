  an investigation of some aspects
of the sonic boom has been made
with the aid of wind-tunnel measurements
of the pressure distributions
about bodies of various shapes .  the
tests were made in the langley
at a mach number of 2.01 and
at a reynolds number per foot of 2.5 x 10 .
measurements of the pressure
field were made at orifices in the surface
of a boundary-layer bypass
plate .  the models which represented both
fuselage and wing types of
thickness distributions were small enough
to allow measurements as far
away as 8 body lengths or 64 chords .  the
results are compared with
estimates made using existing theory .
  to the first order, the boom-producing
pressure rise across the bow
shock is dependent on the longitudinal
development of body area and not
on local details .  nonaxisymmetrical shapes
may be replaced by
equivalent bodies of revolution to obtain satisfactory
theoretical estimates
of the far-field pressures .
