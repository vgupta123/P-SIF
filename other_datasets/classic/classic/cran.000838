bending and compression tests of pressurised ring-stiffened
cylinders .
  the results of tests on pressurized ring-stiffened cylinders
subjected to compression and bending are presented and discussed .  the
results obtained at high values of internal pressure differ from those
obtained by previous investigators in that the theoretical
small-deflection compressive buckling coefficient of 0.6 was nearly achieved
in each test .  small amounts of internal pressure had a greater
stabilizing effect in the bending tests than in the compression tests .
