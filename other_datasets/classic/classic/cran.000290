dynamic stability of a missile in rolling flight .
dynamic stability of a missile in rolling flight .
  the paper sets down the equations of motion for a symmetric
rolling missile with respect to axes attached to the missile .  the
missile may be jet (or rocket) propelled or coasting under
accelerating or decelerating conditions, respectively, wherein the
variable rolling velocity is derived from intentionally or
unintentionally /canted/ fins and or wings .
  the equations contain a force and moment system that
includes, in addition to the usual forces and moments, those due to
magnus effects, misaligned surfaces, canted surfaces, jet
misalignment, and the linear accelerations in the plane normal to the
missile axis .
  the results present general stability criteria for a rolling missile
which are summarized in the /discussion of stability ./
