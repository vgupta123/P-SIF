Multiword List Items
The list concept as originally proposed by
Newell, Simon and Shaw specified single computer 
words as elements of a list.  This report describes the
use of two or more consecutive words as one element. 
 Such use results in a considerable saving in both the
space required to hold a given amount of data, 
and in the execution time required to perform a given
process on the data.  Following a brief description 
of standard list structures with single-word items, the
multiword items are introduced.  Then variable-length 
items are described, along with the corresponding space-utilization
problems.  Finally, several examples 
are given to illustrate the use of multiword lists. This
paper attempts to draw together various recent 
papers which have applied some of these concepts in different
ways, and indicate how they relate to the 
more general problems.
