axisymmetric large deflections of circular plates subjected
to thermal and mechanical load .
  this paper is concerned with the nonlinear
axisymmetric analysis of circular plates with in-plane
edge restraint .  both temperature and mechanical
loads are accommodated as an extension of
investigations performed for the isothermal mechanical
loading problem .  an exact mathematical
formulation within the framework of the v. karman large
strain-displacement relations is developed .  the
equilibrium equations and boundary conditions are then
derived by utilizing the calculus of variations for
arbitrary axisymmetrical temperatures and normal
distributed loading .  the satisfaction of equilibrium and
compatibility equations requires the solution of two
simultaneous nonlinear ordinary differential equations
subject to the prescribed boundary conditions .
analytical solutions of such equations are apparently not
possible and therefore numerical procedures must be
employed .
  a finite difference procedure utilizing /relaxed
iterations,/ developed by h. keller and e. reiss, and
employed by them for the solution of isothermal
problems with apparently unlimited load parameter ranges,
is used here for combined thermo-mechanical problems .
numerical results are presented for the special case of
a simply supported circular plate with radially
immovable boundaries, subject to a uniform pressure and an
arbitrary temperature variation through the thickness
tained for a large range of temperature and load
parameters .  however, because of space limitations, only
a limited amount of data are presented in this paper .
