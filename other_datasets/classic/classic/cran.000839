the bending stability of thin-- walled unstiffened
circular cylinders including the effects of internal
pressure .
  in a recent paper, the authors presented a statistical,
semiempirical design procedure for the determination of the buckling
strength of unpressurized and pressurized cylinders under axial
compression .  this procedure has been extended in the present
paper to the bending of unpressurized and pressurized cylindrical
shells and allows the calculation of the critical bending stress with
a knowledge of the cylinder geometry and the internal pressure
only .
  because no published data could be found, an extensive series
of bending tests of pressurized cylinders has been performed .
these new data for pressurized cylinders are treated
semiempirically together with all of the other known test data for
unpressurized cylinders .  best-fit curves are presented using applicable
theoretical parameters .  design curves for determining the
critical buckling stress for unpressurized and pressurized cylinders
in bending are then developed as 90 per cent probability curves
from the test data .
