A Method for Incrementally Compiling
Languages with Nested Statement Structure
A method of incremental compilation is presented
which applies especially to programming languages 
in which statements can be nested (such as Algol and
PL/I).  The method permits editing of the source 
language using a general purpose text editor, and incremental
processing of changes without frequent 
recompilation of entire routines.  The essential points
of the method are: (1) the syntax of the language 
is restricted insof ar as which constructs may occur
on lines; (2) an internal data structure (called 
the skeleton) is maintained to represent the statement
structure; (3) the recompilation is partially 
batched in the sense that recompilation of modified lines
does not occur until the last of a set of editing 
commands has been received; and (4) the parsing and
compilation are factored into two parts, that done 
on individual lines and that done globally to
handle the relationships between the lines.
