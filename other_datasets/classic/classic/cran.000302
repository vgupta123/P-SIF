approximations for the thermodynamic and transport properties of high
temperature air .
the thermodynamic and transport properties of high-temperature air are
found in closed form starting from approximate partition functions for
the major components in air and neglecting all minor components . the
compressibility, enthalpy, entropy, the specific heats, the speed of
sound, the coefficients of viscosity and of thermal conductivity, and
the prandtl numbers for air are tabulated from 500degree to 15,000degree
 k over a range of pressure from 0.0001 to 100 atmospheres . the energy
of air and the mol fractions of the major components of air can be found
 from the tabulated values for compressibility and enthalpy . it is
predicted that the prandtl number for fully ionized air, which is in
complete equilibrium, will become small compared to unity, the order of
transparent to heat flux .
