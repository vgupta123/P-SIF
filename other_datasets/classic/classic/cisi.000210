Survey of Medical Literature Borrowed from the National Lending Library
for Science and Technology
   This paper reports the results of a four-week questionnaire survey carried 
out at the National Lending Library (N.L.L.), Great Britian, to discover which
types of organizations were the principal users of medical literature, what 
types of literature were used, and which were the main sources of references
to medical publications..Industrial organizations and universities accounted
for the majority (62 percent) of the loans, most of which were English-language
periodicals published since 1960.. For the whole sample, citation list in 
periodical articles were the principal sources of references, although for
literature published in the last fifteen months, abstracting and indexing
journals were the main sources.. Of the latter, Index Medicus proved to be the
most fruitful source of references.. By asking whether the item requested was
really useful to their work, a measure of the reliability of the different
sources of references was obtained..
   Appendixes include the questionnaire, a list of the most frequently borrowed
journals, and a list of abstracting and indexing journals used as sources of
references..
