Automatic Document Classification   Part II. Additional Experiments
   This study reports the results of a series of experiments in the techniques
of automatic document classification.. Two different classification schedules 
are compared along with two methods of automatically classifying documents into 
categories.. It is concluded that, while there is no significant difference in 
the predictive efficiency between the Bayesian and the factor score methods, 
automatic document classification is enhanced by the use of a 
factor-analytically-derived classification schedule.. Approximately 55 percent 
of the documents were automatically and correctly classified..
