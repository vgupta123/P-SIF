effect of uniformly distributed roughness on turbulent
skin-friction drag at supersonic speeds .
  an experimental program was carried out in the 18-in. by
20-in. supersonic wind tunnel of the jet propulsion laboratory to
determine the effect of uniformly distributed sand-grain
roughness on the skin-friction drag of a body of revolution for the case
of a turbulent boundary layer .  the mach number range
covered was 1.98 to 4.54, and the reynolds number varied from
about 3 x 10 to 8 x 10 .  some data were also obtained at a
mach number of 0.70 .
  at speeds up to a mach number of 5 and for roughness sizes
such that the quadratic resistance law holds, the compressibility
effect is indirect, and the skin-friction drag is a function of only
the roughness reynolds number, exactly as in the
incompressible case .  it is shown that the entire compressibility effect
is a reduction of the fluid density at the surface as the mach
number increases .  the critical roughness, below which the
surface is hydraulically smooth, is,. this is equal
to the thickness of the laminar sublayer for a smooth surface for
both compressible and incompressible flow .  over the range of
roughness sizes considered here, there appears to be no wave drag
associated with the drag due to roughness .  the shift in the
turbulent veocity profile for a rough surface at supersonic
speeds is a function of only the roughness reynolds number
and quantitatively follows exactly the same law as that
for the incompressible case .
