Using Computers in Higher Education:
Past Recommendations, Status, and Needs
Data from a survey conducted with National
Science foundation support, which was published 
in December 1970, is reviewed, and it is pointed out
that, with regard to computers in higher education, 
national goals stated in the Rosser and Pierce Reports
have not been attained.  Quality was lacking in 
hardware or courses in nearly half of the associate
and bachelor's degree programs in data processing, 
computer science, etc., offered in 1966-67.  A plea
is made for continuing studies on status and goals 
for computing in higher education, improvement of degree
programs, and a national testing laboratory 
for educational technology.
