User Training for On-Line Information Retrieval Systems
   The early 1970's have clearly shown a trend toward the use of on-line systems
as the ideal medium for information retrieval.. The emphasis placed on direct 
access by the practitioners in the field, rather than delegated searches through
information specialists, leads to the growing need for an efficient design in 
training transient user groups.. Printed manuals, live help, audiovisual 
presentations and on-line instructions have all been used with varying degrees of
success.. The author contends that the use of computer-assisted instruction in 
conjunction with the on-line information retrieval system is the most promising
form of instruction in that the medium itself, as well as the message may be 
used to acquaint the novice searcher with an interactive user/system 
interface..
