steady and transient free convection of an electrically
conducting fluid from a vertical plate in the presence
of a magnetic field .
  an analysis is made for the laminar
free convection and heat transfer of
a viscous electrically conducting fluid
from a hot vertical plate in the case
when the induced field is negligible
compared to the imposed magnetic field .
it is found that similar solutions for
velocity and temperature exist when
the imposed magnetic field (acting
perpendicular to the plate) varies inversely
as the fourth root of the distance from
the lowest end of the plate .  explicit
expressions for velocity, temperature,
boundary layer thickness and nusselt
number are obtained and the effect
of a magnetic field on them is studied .
it is found that the effect of the
magnetic field is to decrease the rate of
heat transfer from the wall .  in the
second part, the method of characteristics
is employed to obtain solutions of
the time-dependent hydromagnetic free
convection equations (hyperbolic) of
momentum and energy put into integral
form .  the results yield the time required
for the steady flow to be established,
and the effect of the magnetic field on this time is studied .
