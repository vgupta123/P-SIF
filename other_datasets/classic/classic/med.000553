role of the liver in the glycoprotein mobilizing property of
parathyroid extract
studies were carried out to de-
termine the action of hepatectomy on the
glycoprotein action of pte as well as on
pte-induced renal calcification and deposi-
tion of glycoprotein.  our data showed that
in hepatectomized rats, pte no longer caused
an elevation in serum glycoproteins.  how-
ever, hepatectomy did not alter the forma-
tion of glycoprotein tubular casts produced
by pte administration.  the data suggest
that the liver is the major source of the ele-
vated serum glycoproteins found in rats re-
ceiving pte.  in addition, it is possible that
pte may have a direct stimulating action
on biosynthesis of glycoprotein by the kidney.
