pressure distribution induced on a flat plate at a free-stream
mach number of 1.39 by rockets exhausting upstream and downstream .
an experimental investigation was made of the pressures induced on
a flat plate at a free-stream mach number of 1.39 by a supersonic
rocket jet exhausting upstream and downstream .  measurements of the
pressure distribution on a flat plate were made at zero angle of
attack for 11 different locations of the jet exhaust nozzle beneath
the wing .  measurements were made at ratios of rocket-exit total
pressure to free-stream static pressure from 6 to 60 and at a reynolds
number per foot of approximately 10 times 10 to the power of 6 .  the
rocket when exhausted upstream produced a strong shock that moved
further upstream with increasing rocket-exit total-pressure ratio .
positive incremental normal-force coefficients were obtained at all test
positions .  data at 11 test positions are tabulated for rocket-on
and rocket-off pressure coefficients as well as for incremental pressure
coefficients for the 48 orifices of the flat plate for the range of
ratio of rocket-exit total pressure to free-stream static pressure
of the investigation .  changing the location of the model with
respect to the plate had a negligible effect when the rocket was
varied in the chordwise direction, but the pressure coefficients
were reduced as the rocket was lowered away from the flat-plate wing .
