Automatic Abstracting and Indexing..
II. Production of Indicative Abstracts by Application of Contextual 
Inference and Syntactic Coherence Criteria
   Together with the increasing shortage of qualified abstracts, the factors 
of time, cost and value have lent impetus to a trend toward the automatic 
generation of abstracts and indexes.. This trend has caused increased emphasis
to be placed on the abstract as the locus of data for automatic retrieval
systems.. This necessitates the creating of high quality abstracts.. It is the
purpose of this paper to report on the development of techniques for the 
automatic production of high quality abstracts from the full text of the 
original document.. It is necessary to analyze the conditions under which 
various methods of sentence selection are successful, in order to develop 
criteria for selecting sentences to form an abstract.. But clearly, an abstract 
can be produced by rejecting sentences of the original which are irrelevant to 
the abstract.. As will be seen, it is this point which is perhaps the most
significant contribution of this paper.. Methods of sentence selection and
rejection are discussed.. These include contextual inference, intersentence
reference, frequency criteria, and coherency considerations.. The automatic
abstracting system we have developed consists basically of a dictionary, called 
the Word Control List, and of a set of rules for implementing certain functions
specified for each WCL entry.. The abstracts we have obtained so far are of
sufficiently good quality to indicate that large-scale testing of the methods
of the automatic abstracting system is warranted..
