Weeding Library Collections
    This book is based upon two recent research projects in weeding and
identifying core collections.  However, it became apparent that the principles
and techniques studied are applicable to almost all types of library 
collections.
    This work has been designed to be used for four distinct purposes:
    1. As a comprehensive source summarizing the opinion, knowledge, and
serious research in the field of weeding.  The author's own research is 
reported in such detail that replication of the studies is possible.  In
addition, this book contains the first report of the Harrison study.
    2. As a do-it-yourself guide for librarians wishing to weed out their
present collections.  It is the aim of this book not only to explain and
justify its methods, but to include a step-by-step procedure for "weeding
without tears."
    3. As a textbook in library schools, especially in courses that deal with
the acquisition and maintenance of library collections, for weeding is one 
of the best techniques available for the long-range building of useful 
collections.
    4. As a stimulus to further study in this entire area.  It is hoped that
libraries using the recommended methods will measure and report upon the costs
of weeding and the impact of such weeding upon changes in the amount of
circulation and in user satisfaction.
