Guide to Reference Books
  The fundamental principles of reference work remain
more or less constant through the years, but the rapid
expansion of the publication of reference books in all
fields makes essential a careful selection to fit the needs
of each library.  The purpose of this volume is to list
reference books basic to research - general and special -
and thus to serve as: (1) a reference manual for the
library assistant, research worker, or other user of
library resources; (2) a selection aid for the librarian; and
(3) a textbook for the student, who, either in library
school, training class, or college course in bibliography,
is pursuing a systematic study of reference books.
  The needs of these types of users have influenced the
organization and make-up of this volume, in that the
requirements of the first two groups have made the
manual more comprehensive than it might have been if
intended for a textbook only, while the introductions to
sections and many of the annotations have been provided
particularly for the library school student.
