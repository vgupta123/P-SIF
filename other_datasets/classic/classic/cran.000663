viscous flow along a flat plate moving at high speeds .
  by the distortion of coordinates, it is shown that, in the case
of supersonic viscous flow past a flat plate, the boundary-layer
and simple wave theories can be combined to give a complete
representation of the velocity and pressure fields .  consistent
first-order solutions are considered .  an expression for the
induced pressure on the plate, correct to the second order, is
obtained .  at high mach numbers the important parameter
satisfies the hypersonic similarity law ,. and for arbitrary mach and
reynolds numbers and for different gases, the theoretical curve
correlates closely the experimental data .  asymptotic shock
curve and skin-friction coefficient are also deduced, but the
experimental verifications are yet to be made .
