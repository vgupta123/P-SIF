an approximate solution of the compressible laminar
boundary layer on a flat plate .
  following a major assumption that enthalpy and velocity are dependent
only on local conditions, an enthalpy-velocity relation
is obtained for the laminar boundary layer on a flat plate where
subscripts p refer to the plate, 1 to the free stream and e to the
equilibrium temperature condition at the plate .  when compared with
general results, this relation (exact for prandtl number o = 1)
gives a close approximation to crocco's numerical results for o = 0.725
and 1.25, up to .
  using the above relation in conjunction with the approximate
viscosity-temperature relation suggested by chapman and rubesin, and
with young's suggested first approximation for shearing stress it is
shown that close approximations to displacement thickness and velocity
distribution are given by and where and which serves to define c .
  these have the advantage of being algebraic in form whereas previous
results have involved complex numerical integrations for individual
cases .
