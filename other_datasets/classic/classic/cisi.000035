Comparisons of Four Types of Lexical Indicators of Content
An experiment was conducted to determine which of 
four types of lexical indicators of content could be
utilized best by subjects to determine relevant from
irrelevant documents and to answer a set of 100
questions.  The results indicate that there were no
major differences between the groups using complete
text and abstracts to select relevant documents, but
the group utilizing the complete text obtained a
significantly higher score on the examination.
