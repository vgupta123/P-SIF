The Next 700 Programming Languages 
A family of unimplemented computing languages
is described that is intended to span differences 
of application area by a unified framework.  This framework
dictates the rules about the uses of user-coined 
names, and the conventions about characterizing functional
relationships.  Within this framework the 
design of a specific language splits into two independent
parts.  One is the choice of written appearances 
of programs (or more generally, their physical representation).
 The other is the choice of the abstract 
entities (such as numbers, character-strings, lists
of them, functional relations among them) that can 
be referred to in the language.  The system is biased
towards "expressions" rather than "statements." 
 It includes a nonprocedural(purely functional) subsystem
that aims to expand the class of users' needs 
that can be met by a single print-instruction, without sacrificing
the important properties that make 
conventional right-hand-side expressions easy to construct and understand.
