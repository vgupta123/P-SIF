  a wind-tunnel investigation was
conducted at a mach number of 1.96
and at reynolds numbers (based on the
mean aerodynamic chord of the
exposed wing) of 0.36 and 1.03 million
to determine the normal forces,
pitching moments, and rolling moments
contributed by each wing panel of
a cruciform-wing and body combination
over a wide range of combined
angles of pitch and roll .  the wings
were triangular of aspect ratio 2,
and the body was an ogive-cylinder
combination .  the effects of forebody
length and roughness and of the
presence of the adjacent panels on these
panel contributions were determined .
  the results of the investigation
show that large changes in the panel
forces and moments can occur as the
result of combined angles .  a general
theoretical method based on slender-body
and strip theories was found to
yield results in good agreement with the
wind-tunnel measurements .  these
comparisons indicate that the changes in
the panel characteristics due to
combined angles are caused primarily by
a cross coupling between the
side-wash velocities due to angle of attack
and sideslip and by the presence
of forebody vortices due to crossflow
separation .  it was found that an
increase in forebody length increases
the effect of the forebody vortices
because of the dependence of the strength
of these vortices on the forebody
length .
