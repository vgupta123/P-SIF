Experiments in Book Indexing by Computer
   The most challenging task in preparing an index to a book is to select all 
and only those terms that are related to the text and are useful for relevance 
purposes.. While a knowledgeable human can make the selection on an intuitive 
basis, automatic indexing requires a precise operational criterion for defining 
and selecting good and useful index terms.. Two principles of selection are 
proposed:specification and selection of useful terms, and specification and 
exclusion of useless terms.. Because of the nebulous nature and meaning of
"good index terms", and the difficulties involved in devising machine algorithms
for their selection, this research in automatic indexing is based on the 
principle of excluding useless terms.. Even so,fully automatic indexing was not 
achieved in this study.. Single words proved to be little value as index terms..
Multiple word terms were generated by the computer, but no algorithm could 
successfully eliminate the useless phrases.. Final selection had to be made by 
the experimenter.. A comprehensive and useful book index was achieved by using 
machine-aided rather than fully automated indexing techniques..
