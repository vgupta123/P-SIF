Problems in Information Retrieval: 
 Logical Jumps in the Expression of Information
   In a structured data base, such as that obtained when information is indexed
in a format including explicit relations, retrieval of all relevant items in
response to a question may, in some cases, be restricted by technicalities of 
the structure.. Condensations in the form of logical jumps, or the omission of 
a concept with one relation out of a string of three concepts with two 
interstitial relations, have been investigated by two different methods, in 
order to overcome one of these technicalities.. Thirty-two rules are proposed
which could permit the automatic condensation of either of both the stored 
information and the question, when the concepts and relations are in the form 
of linear or string display.. Nine rules are proposed for condensation of 
angular structures.. Other type of logical jump and abbreviation are discussed, 
together with related studies of expansions and inference steps..
