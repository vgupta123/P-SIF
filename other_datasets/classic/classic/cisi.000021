On Aggression
  In this book, Lorenz deals with the evolution of aggression
in vertebrates.  He points out that aggressivity is totally different
from predation: that it is a biological necessity for defence of
territory and for a cornered animal, and that it becomes mixed
up with other innate drives, thus leading up towards reduction
of intraspecific damage. This, be it noted, is most evident in
fiercer social predators like wolves, where escape from the pack
is virtually impossible and where co-operation without fighting
is necessary for survival; whereas in the non-social but proverbially
peaceful dove prevention of escape leads to violent and often
fatal attacks on the weaker mate.
  In a final chapter he advances some suggestion as to how in
the human species, where evolution is primarily cultural, and
not guided by Darwinian selection in the strict sense, the
aggressive drive may be canalized into less dangerous channels.
Man has innumerable ways of adaptively ritualizing his behavior,
many of them analogous, if not homologous, to those found in
animals.  In any event, On Aggression is a fascinating book by
a master of his subject.
