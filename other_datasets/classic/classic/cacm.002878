Joining Policies in a Multipriority Multiclass Batch Computer System
Consider a multipriority batch computer system
which users from several different classes may 
join, its toll, service, and waiting charges.  Such a
system is formulated here as a semi-Markov decision 
process, in which the aim of arriving users is to minimize
their expected loss.  The optimal joining 
policy is one of arriving users who may join the system
at some of its queues is a control limit policy, 
with a single control number for any possible queue
and the user's class; a newly arriving user will 
join a queue that is not filled up to the control number
corresponding to this queue and the user's class. 
 In this paper control numbers, as well as lower and upper
bounds for the control numbers and the capacities 
of the system's queues, are derived.
