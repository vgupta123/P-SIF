A  Nonrecursive List Compacting Algorithm 
A simple nonrecursive list structure compacting scheme or garbage 
collector suitable for both compact and LISP-like list structures is presented.
The algorithm avoids the need for recursion by using the partial structure as 
it is built up to keep track of those lists that have been copied.
