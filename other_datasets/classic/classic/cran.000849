a theory of imperfection for the vibrations of elastic bodies of
revolution .
various observations and preliminary experiments
have shown that the effect of imperfections upon the
vibrations of bodies of revolution cannot be neglected .
owing to the possibility of applying the lagrange
equation, the influence of the imperfections could be
traced through the kinetic energy, the potential energy
and the dissipation function .  although the fundamental
difficulty of the uncertainty of certain variables
was not eliminated, this procedure permitted at least
the making of general qualitative statements as to the
behaviour of the system if imperfections are present .
