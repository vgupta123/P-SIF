An Implemented Graph Algorithm for Winning Shannon Switching games
In this tutorial paper a computer program
which wins Shannon Switching Games is described.
 Since these games are played on graphs, the program
is a good example of the implementation of graph 
algorithms.  The two players in a Shannon Switching Game,
CONNECT and CUT, have nonsimilar goals.  Either 
CONNECT, CUT, or the player moving first is guaranteed
the existence of a winning strategy.  The simple 
strategy explained in this paper is valid in all three
cases.  In fact, the major routines never need 
to know whether the computer is CONNECT or CUT.
