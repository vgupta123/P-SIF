MEDLINE Evaluation Study
   MEDLINE (MEDLARS-ON-LINE) is the new on-line, interactive bibliographic
searching system which was recently developed by the National Library of 
Medicine.. The system provides users with lists of bibliographical citations
and other information from a three-year file of over 1,250 biomedical
journals.. A survey testing user reactions was conducted at the University of
Virginia Medical Library.. The results of the survey are based on replies by
246 users who requested one or more MEDLINE searches between September 1972 and
March 1973.. The findings indicate that over 93% believe that MEDLINE is a 
substantial improvement over the traditional methods of searching through the
printed indexes.. These respondents also stated that the results of MEDLINE
searches had assisted them in their clinical or research work, or both.. Asked
whether they would continue to use MEDLINE after the imposition of user charges
on July 1, 1973, about 75% said that they would.. The remaining 25% expressed
some reservation and doubts.. The survey gives reason to believe that with the
imposition of user charges the use of MEDLINE will decline..
