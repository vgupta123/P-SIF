An Indirect Method of Information Retrieval
   The information retrieval process, treated strictly as a matching procedure,
has the defects that tha whole file must be probed for each query, and that it
overlooks the fact that the relevance of the information from one document 
depends upon what is already known about the subject, and in term affects the 
relevance of other documents subsequently examined.. A mathematical model of a 
search technique in which the defects of the direct method are taken into account 
is demonstrated by an experiment in which a given paper is treated as an enquiry
and the references cited in the paper are treated as relevant answers.. The
results in two tests show much better results than those achieved by the direct 
method.. No spurious material was retrieved by either method..
