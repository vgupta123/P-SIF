Representation of Concept Relations Using the TOSAR System of
the IDC: Treatise III on Information Retrieval Theory
   Successful information retrieval from a mechanized file is heavily
dependent on the fidelity of the representation of concepts in the
particular language of the system and on the predictability of this
representation.. 
   If an index language is employed, predictability is guaranteed and
the quality of the retrieval is predominantly governed by the fidelity
of the representation, i.e., by the extent to which conceptual
distortion of the concepts to be represented can be avoided.. The various
index languages vary widely with respect to their fidelity.. Differences
in their performance are correspondingly great..
   The lack of fidelity in most of the present day indexing languages
is due mainly to insufficient representation of the relationships
among concepts.. We describe a new graphical method of storing and
retrieving concept relations of various kinds.. The points of such a
graph are occupied by concepts, and the connecting lines between these
points represent concept relations.. In a special field of chemistry,
these graphs also serve as a kind of presentation of the essentials of a
document to the reader that is much more lucid than a natural language
text..
