The Review Article: Its Characteristics and Problems
   The characteristics and problems associated with the review literature in the
sciences were examined.. Three major classes of review articles were identified:
(1) the annual review which aims to provide a systematic record of the 
contributions made within the previous year, (2) the critical review which 
selectively evaluates contributions to the solution of a common research problem,
and (3) data compilations which are concerned with facts and findings rather 
than the opinions of the authors of papers from which the data are taken.. The
role and control of the review article in medicine was described.. Over the
past fifteen years, the ratio of review to nonreview articles in medicine has 
been on the order of 1:38.. Possible solutions to a number of problems associated
with the review literature are discussed, such as the selection of articles for 
review..Further examination of some critical questions relating to the production
and organization of reviews will have to be undertaken before the review, as a
means of bringing the most significant information to its users, will be 
accepted as a reliable adjunct to the original publications..
