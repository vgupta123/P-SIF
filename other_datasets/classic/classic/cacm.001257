DEBUG-An Extension to Current On-Line Debugging Techniques
A method of on-linr assembly-language debugging
which greatly simplifies several of the bookkeeping 
tasks characteristically associated with that process
has been developed and implemented in a program 
for the UNIVAC M-460 computer at Air Force Cambridge Research
Laboratories.  With this program, an online 
user may insert or delete (in symbolic assembly language)
any number of lines at any point of his previously 
assembled program in core, with the remainder
of the program being relocated appropriately.
