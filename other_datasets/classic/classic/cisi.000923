Library Education: an introductional survey
        Social structures have changed more quickly during
    the last one hundred years than during any other equivalent
    period in history.  With these changes have come alternations
    in the role of institutions of higher education.  During
    the Centennial Year we shall try to measure the need and
    nature of further change and to evolve ideas that may
    influence its direction.

    In keeping with this idea, the Graduate School of Library Science
of the University of Illinois felt that this indeed was a time propitious
for holding an International Conference on Education for Librarianship.
The profession as a whole and library education in particular are still
quite young, but in less than one hundred years we have seen revolutionary
changes.  Demands have been made on the world's libraries, and in turn on
the schools' training personnel for these libraries, almost too rapidly
for them to satisfy.  It seemed logical for library education, therefore,
"to measure the need and nature of future change and to evolve ideas that
may influence its direction."
