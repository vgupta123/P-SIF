Criteria for Evaluating Technical Library Effectiveness
  In July 1966 John I. Thompson & Company accepted a contract with the
Picatinny Arsenal, US Department of the Army, to perform a study aimed
at developing 'Criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of library
operations and services' under the ATLIS Program (Army Technical
Library Improvement Studies).  The study was divided into three
phases aimed at:
    I A Literature search to reflect the current 'state-of-the
      art' covering library standards and the methods of evaluating
      libraries developed up to the present.
   II A phase in which to gather and evaluate any data required from
      Army Technical Libraries, from available surveys already
      published, or from any other sources, by which to develop
      criteria.
  III A phase in which to establish and validate the criteria.
  Phases I and II of the study are now complete.  Phase III is in progress
and is expected to be completed by the late fall of 1968.  The reports of
Phases I and II are already available for detailed study and that of
Phase III will be available soon.  The purpose of this paper is to present
some of the findings of the study.
