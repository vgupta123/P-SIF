laminar boundary layers at the interface of co-current
parallel streams .
  the approximate solution of keulegan(1) for the steady flow of a
stream of viscous incompressible fluid over another at rest is extended
to the case where both fluids are moving co-current but at different
velocities .  this solution utilizes a sextic polynomial for the
velocity distribution in the boundary layers .  the solutions depend
only on the ratio of the velocities of the two streams and on the
product of the corresponding viscosity and density ratios .  numerical
results are given for seven values of at one value of .  lock(2) has
published an exact solution with a numerical result for and the sextic
polynomial solution is evaluated f40umerical result for and the sextic
indicates that in general the sextic polynomial is more accurate than
the quartic polynomial but that the advantage is not great .
