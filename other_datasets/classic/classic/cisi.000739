A Rapid Generalized Minicomputer Text Search System Incorporating Algebraic
Entry of Boolean Strategies
   This paper presents a rapid and efficient generalized minicomputer text 
searching system.. The system has been applied to Chemical Condensates and
enjoys search speeds comparable to services operating on large computer 
systems.. Complete Boolean algebraic search strategy expressions may be used as 
direct entries, and all forms of transaction are automatically processed.. 
Benchmark search speeds and results are presented for realistic profiles 
serving varied research groups in a major university chemistry department..
