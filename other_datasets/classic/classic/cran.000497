theoretical and experimental investigation of thermal
stresses in hypersonic aircraft wing structures .
  a simple and relatively accurate analytic approximation is
developed to determine the temperature and thermal-stress
distribution in aircraft wing structures .  theoretical investigations
show that the results of the existing thermal-stress theories
which neglect the temperature gradient through the skin
thickness may exceed, in the range of higher biot numbers, the true
values by more than 30 percent .
  refined photothermoelastic experiments verify these results
and add another significant conclusion .  they indicate that
thermal stresses in wing structures generated by a variable
heat-transfer coefficient coincide with the theoretical predictions
which are based on a constant heat-transfer coefficient, as long
as the latter represents the arithmetic average over the heating
cycle and the variation is in the order of 10 percent .
however, even much greater variations in the order of 100 percent
produce only relatively small differences .
