A String Language for Symbol Manipulation Based on ALGOL 60
An artificial computer programming language
is proposed for describing the manipulation of 
strings of characters and symbols.  The concept of strings,
introduced in the ALGOL 60 report, is extended 
by adding: (1) the declaration of strings, substrings,
and string arrays with explicit lengths; (2) the 
ability to concatenate and shift strings; and (3) the
ranking of symbols for comparing stings in Boolean 
relations.  A primer or informal description of the
language is followed by examples, a description of 
experiments with the language on an IBM 704 computer,
and a formal description which, taken with the 
ALGOL 60 Report, defines the proposed string language.
