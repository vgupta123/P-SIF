aerofoil theory of a flat delta wing at supersonic
speeds .
  lift, drag, and pressure distribution of a triangular
flat plate moving at a small incidence at supersonic
speeds are given for arbitrary mach number and aspect ratio .
the values obtained for lift and drag are compared with
the corresponding values obtained by strip theory .  the
possibility of further applications of the analysis leading up
to the above results is indicated .
