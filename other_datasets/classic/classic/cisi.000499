Experiments in Automatic Extracting and Indexing
   This article reports on several experiments in automatic extracting and one
experiment in automating indexing.. Nine chapters, each from a different 
technical book, were used as a text corpus for all the experiments.. In the 
first experiment, an attempt was made to construct a sentence dictionary of 
syntactic sentence types, for distinguishing extract-worthy sentences, but it 
proved unrewarding.. Nevertheless, the results indicated that sentence typing
might be used in a screening process in conjunction with other extracting 
techniques.. The later attempts to combine synactic and statistical criteria 
in the choice of extract sentences and index phrases proved more rewarding.. 
The sentences selected  by the extracting algorithm  were representative and 
are presented for the reader to peruse.. The noun phrases selected by the 
indexing algorithm compared favorably with the back-of-the-book index phrases..
There is every indication that satisfactory back-of-the-book indexes could be 
produced automatically, with post-editing to delete superfluous items..
