heat transfer to constant property laminar boundary
layer flows with power function free stream velocity
and wall temperature variation .
  numerical computations have been performed for the
boundary-layer form of the energy equation for incompressible flows
with power-function variation of free-stream velocity (u =
cx) and of wall temperature (t = ax), the pertinent solutions
of the momentum equation in this case being those of hartree .
the numerical computations given herein are to some extent a
repetition of those given by schuh and by chapman and rubesin,
the object of the present computations being the resolution of
discrepancies appearing in the previous solutions and an extension of
their range .  ibm machine calculations were employed in the
finite difference calculation presently utilized, the results thereof
covering a range of wall-temperature function exponents from
values of m(4, 1, 0, -0.0904) .  the accuracy of the numerical
computations is examined in detail, and the accuracy of the
computed functions at the wall, which determine the heat-transfer
rate, is estimated to be within 2 per cent .
  examination of the results reveals that the results of schuh
for the flat plate are in error .  for the range of the calculations,
it was found that the local heat-transfer coefficient can, with the
exception of large negative values, be expressed within 5
per cent as
where the exponent of the prandtl number varies from 0.254
to 0.367 for -0.0904 and where the function
can be approximated by the equation
