A Mathematical Model for Mechanical part Description
The flexibility of a mathematical model takes
advantage of the common information requirements 
of computer-aided engineering drawing, numerical control
tape generation, and physical characteristic 
computation.  By judicious control of man-machine communication
requirements, improved results over conventional 
engineering design processes are possible.  An English-like
input language, tailored for use by draftsmen 
and designers, will describe the part and specify the
output desired.  One approach to the mathematical 
model consists of a group of surface-defining quadric
equations, which are created by a system of modular 
subprogram.  Other subprograms will convert the mathematical
model into instructions for driving automatic 
drafting machines and numerical controlled machine tools.
 Physical part characteristics, such as center 
of gravity, can be computed by subprograms and used in
dynamic analysis work.  The proposed overall system 
is presented and experiments and demonstrations are discussed.
