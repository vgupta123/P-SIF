an investigation of the pressure distribution on conical bodies in
hypersonic flows .
a large amount of work on conical flow fields without axial symmetry
at supersonic speed is presently available .  however, no apparent
hypersonic approximation has yet been derived .  in this note,
experimental data on two elliptical cones at m = 6 are presented and a
hypersonic approach obtained from physical considerations is suggested .
