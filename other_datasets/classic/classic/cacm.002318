The Role of Computer System Models in Performance Evaluation
Models constitute a useful means of investigating
computer system performance.  This paper 
examines the interrelationships between models and other
methods for evaluating the performance of computer 
systems and establishes circumstances under
which the use of a model is appropriate.
