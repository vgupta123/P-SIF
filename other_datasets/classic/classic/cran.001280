wings with minimum drag due to lift in supersonic flow .
  it has been shown by r. t. jones that, in order to produce
minimum drag, the given lift must be distributed over the wing
surface in such a way that the sum of the downwash induced by
this distribution and the downwash induced in reversed flow is
constant over the wing surface .  this combined downwash can be
expressed by an integral which contains the load as a function
of the spanwise and chordwise coordinate .  the problem of
finding the appropriate load distribution is thus reduced to the
problem of finding the solution of a rather cumbersome integral
equation .
  the severe spanwise singularity of the kernel function is
handled most easily, as in corresponding subsonic problems, by an
approximate integration over interpolation polynomials .  the
chordwise load distribution is represented by a limited series
development in legendre polynomials .  the sigularity of the
kernel function along the mach lines through any pivotal point
can be avoided by a similar legendre development of the
combined induced downwash which is constant .  the integral
equation is thus converted into a system of linear equations for the
unknown coefficients of the legendre functions of the load
distribution at a limited number of spanwise stations .
  practical calculations are carried out on an electronic
computer .  the solutions yield the optimum load distribution and the
local incidence (twist, camber, etc.) necessary to realize this
distribution .  for many wing plan forms, considerable gains
over a plane wing appear possible .
