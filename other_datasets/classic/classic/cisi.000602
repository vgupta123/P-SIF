Informal Communication Among Scientists in Sleep Research
   At the frontiers of an active area of science, social structure based upon 
communication is demonstrated.. Using sociometric techniques, an informal
communication network was identified which included 73% of the scientists..
Within the network was a core group of scientists who were the focus of a
disproportionately large number of contacts and who were differentiated from
others by greater productivity, higher citation record and wider readership..
Information transferred to these scientists is so situated that it could be
transmitted to 95% of the network scientists through one intermediary scientist
or less..
