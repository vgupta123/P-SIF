Efficient Algorithms for Graph Manipulation [H] (Algorithm A447)
Efficient algorithms are presented for partitioning
a graph into connected components, biconnected 
components and simple paths.  The algorithm for partitioning
of a graph into simple paths is iterative 
and each iteration produces a new path between two
vertices already on paths.  (The start vertex can 
be specified dynamically.)  If V is the number of vertices
and E is the number of edges, each algorithm 
requires time and space proportional to max (V,E)
when executed on a random access computer.
