interaction of a charged satellite with the ionosphere .
interaction of a charged satellite with the ionosphere .
  the problem of the ion density distribution around a
charged satellite has been treated by a numerical method
which does not require linearization of the equations or
restriction to infinitesimal objects .  however, magnetic field
effects were not considered, and a number of other
simplifying assumptions were required .  some sample calculations
for spherical satellites are presented, illustrating the
general character of the satellite wake .  calculations of the
so-called /charge drag/ were also made, yielding results
qualitatively similar to those previously obtained by jastrow and pearse .
