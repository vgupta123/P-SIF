Fields of Information on Library of Congress Catalog Cards:
Analysis of a Random Sample, 1950-1964
  The Information Systems Office (ISO) of the Library of Congress has as its 
mission the development and implementation of the main automation
program for the Library and the co-ordination of all LC automation efforts.  
One of the primary activities in this effort is a system-development
study concentrating on the central bibliographic operations, that is, 
acquisitions, cataloging, reference, etc.  This study is now in its early
stages, and it is too soon to predict the actual system that will evolve.  
As an adjunct to this study an analysis of the potential uses of and
problems involved in the machine processing of cataloging data was begun.  One 
aspect of the analysis was the design of a preliminary machine-
readable catalog record.  The results of this work are in a report issued by 
the ISO as its "Planning Memorandum Number 3."
