Distance between Sets as an Objective Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness
   A general measure of retrieval effectiveness having full metric properties 
and treating the "retrieval system - arbiter of relevance"situation 
symmetrically, is the Marczewski-Steinhaus metric, D, measuring the distance 
between the set of relevant documents, A, and set of retrieved documents, B, 
according to D = 1 -(n (A ^ B)/n(A u B)).. D can be expressed as a function of 
Presicion and Recall, or of Generality, Fallout and Recall, and of other sets 
of traditional measures.. Acceptance of the measure allows criteria for 
retrieval optimality and degeneracy to be stated, defined by minimum and 
constant  values of D respectively.. Precision_Recall degeneracy curves for D 
are given and compared with those for another general measure: the probability
that a document will be correctly identified by a retrieval system.. 
Statistical extensions of D are examined, and these and other properties of the
metric are illustrated with seven examples..
