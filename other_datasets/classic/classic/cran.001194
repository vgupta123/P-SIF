magnetohydrodynamic flow past a thin airfoil .
  the steady flow of a perfectly conducting
magnetohydrodynamic fluid past a thin
nonconducting airfoil is studied with the usual model
in which the fluid variables obey the lundquist
equations linearized about a constant unperturbed
flow .  /hyperliptic/ flows, in which
hyperbolic and elliptic fields are superimposed,
are considered .  results of grad, mccune and
resler, and sears and resler are extended and
considered in detail for the case of an arbitrarily
inclined unperturbed field .  the general solution
contains four line singularities along the
characteristics through the ends of the body and
has two arbitrary constants .  by a /
generalized kutta-joukowski condition,/ these constants
are fixed so that two of the line singularities
disappear .  specifically, it is required that the
solution be locally square integrable .  behavior
of the exponents of the singularities is investigated
by numerical computation and, in limiting
cases, analytically .  the singular parts of some flows
are investigated numerically .
