an alternative formulation of the problem of flutter
in real fluids .
it is well known, in steady flow, that the actual lift curve
slope is somewhat less than that predicted by inviscid flow
theory, even at small angles of attack .  as the stall angle is
approached, the lift curve slope continually decreases and thus
deviates even more from the theoretical value .  pinkerton
employed the measured circulation to determine the pressure
distribution and found that the resulting prediction of the moment
is considerably improved over that given by the classical theory .
this amounts to replacing the conventional kutta-joukowski
condition with the condition that the total lift should agree with
the measured value, and this, in turn, completely determines the
flow pattern .  practically, this is accomplished by giving a
fictitious camber to the profile .  since potential flow theory is
valid outside of the boundary layer, once the boundary-layer
thickness is known, the potential flow may be corrected for the
displacement thickness and the viscous wake by appropriate
source distributions .  the boundary layer cannot be evaluated,
of course, until the potential flow is known and the circulation is
applied .  a criterion to determine the circulation, by
generalizing the kutta-joukowski condition, was proposed by preston
and spence by assuming that the pressure at the trailing edge
shall have the same value when determined from the
potential-flow values above and below the airfoil .  this procedure gives
qualitative information concerning viscous effects in steady
flow .
