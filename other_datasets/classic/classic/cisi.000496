The Cost and Costing of Information Storage and Retrieval 
  This presentation on economic aspects of information retrieval is based
on data gathered by Project URBANDOC during the course of four years in
developing documentation services for the literature of urban planning
and renewal.  It was a substantial effort - half a million dollars is
no small sum in the social sciences - made possible by an Urban Renewal
Demonstration Grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development
(HUD) to The City University of New York.  The proposal that initiated the
Project in 1965 grew out of the extensive dissatisfaction with bibliographic
services in planning librarianship at a time when both planners and librarians
were looking to data processing to solve a variety of information problems.
URBANDOC was to apply the techniques of scientific documentation to a body of
literature which had been neglected by the information science community before
the advent of computerization, and completely by-passed by it afterwards.
