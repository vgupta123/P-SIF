The World's Technical Journal Literature:
An Estimate of Volume, Origin, Language,
Field, Indexing, and Abstracting
A quantitative estimate is made of the magnitude of the
world's scientific and technical journal literature problem.
Using a number of basic sources of statistical information,
a composite picture is established to show such things as
the total volume, linguistic and national origins, breakdown
by subject field, and degree of coverage by the abstracting
and indexing services.
