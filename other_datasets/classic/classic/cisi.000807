Free Text Word Retrieval and Scientist Indexing:
Performance Profile and Costs
   Comparative performance profiles were determined, by two independent 
scientific information centres, for on-line retrieval by means of (a) free text 
words and (b) subject indexing codes, from a data base of 4,600 descriptions of 
in-going research projects in four broad subject areas.. Altogether, thirty-nine
questions that users had previously asked of the Science Information Exchange
(SIE) of the Smithsonian Institution, and that were in the four subjects areas,
were employed by SIE staff scientists, and twelve of these were independently 
used by staff members of the Biological Science Communication Project (BSCP) of 
the George Washington University.. Results of the two studies showed average 
recall values 30-40% higher, and relevance values 15-20% higher, for subject 
index code use as compared with text word use.. Advantages and disadvantages of 
both approaches are discussed..
