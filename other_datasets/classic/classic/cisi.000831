The Effect of a Large-Scale Photocopying Service on Journal Sales
   The proposition is examined that large-scale photocopying, such as that 
practised by the British Library Lending Division, affects the sales of 
journals.. There is little evidence of a reduction in journal circulation
figures.. In spite of large increases in journal prices (which have risen much
faster, in terms of cost per page, than the Retail Price Index), university
libraries have, since the NLLST was established, devoted an increasingly high 
proportion of their budgets to journals, though recent financial pressures are 
now forcing cancellation.. An extensive survey of demand for journals at BLLD 
shows a heavy concentration on a relatively small number of titles, most of them 
well established journals, widely held by libraries and with large 
circulations.. The demand for in-print issues of the average journal is small..
It is concluded, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that economic
difficulties experienced by journals publishers and the increased demand on the 
BLLD are unrelated, though both owe something to the economic pressures on 
libraries..
