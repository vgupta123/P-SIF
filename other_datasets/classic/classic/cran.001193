some exact solutions for cavitating curvilinear bodies .
  a special case of cavitating flow solutions is
postulated and transformed to a semi-infinite
plane .  the complete, exact solution then is
synthesized by superposition of singularities .
the solution is relevant to a general, two-parameter
family of curvilinear bodies .  the
parameters are the flow angles at the two points of flow
separation .  the body reduces, in the special
case, to the rayleigh solution for a flat plate .
the equations of the cavity boundaries are
given in explicit form .  the body form and the
stagnation streamline are given as the locus of
the roots of a cubic equation .  local static
pressures and, hence, lift and drag, also may be
calculated .  the generated solutions constitute
a technique involving simple computation
for exact solutions of a special family of cavitating
curvilinear bodies at finite angles of attack .
