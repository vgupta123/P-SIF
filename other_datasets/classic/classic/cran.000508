a correlation of nose-bluntness induced pressures on
cylindrical and conical after-bodies at hypersonic
speeds .
van hise, in his detailed study of the nose-bluntness-induced
pressures on cylindrical afterbodies, shows that, starting
a few nose diameters aft of the nose-afterbody junction, these
pressures are correlated with the parameter
as predicted by the blast-wave analogy .  chernyi developed a
modified form of the blast-wave analogy which takes into account
the addition of energy to the flow by a thin afterbody .  he
showed that for thin afterbodies and hypersonic speeds, the
pressure distribution, plotted as should correlate with
the parameter .  the purpose of this note
is to show that the above correlation techniques may be
combined into a form such that pressures on cylindrical and conical
afterbodies are correlated by one parameter .
