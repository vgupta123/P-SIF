Introduction to University Library Administration
   The last ten years have witnessed the growth of
an intense public interest in university affairs.  Almost anything
to do with universities is now headline news.  Previously such attention
as they did receive was limited to brief reports in sober middle class
newspapers of appointments, awards and meetings, leavened once a
year by an obligatory account in all newspapers of the Boat Race.
All this has changed: as Michael Befoff comments in his book The
Plateglass Universities (having made the foregoing points and more
besides), what were once ivory towers have now become goldfish
bowls.
   He goes on to give the obvious explanation for the change: 
universities are of public interest because they are now almost wholly
supported by the taxpayers' money.  They represent a massive investment
on the part of the government, and consequently are expected to
yield a vitally important return in trained and educated manpower.
Over the last twenty years government expenditure in this country
on universities has risen from four million pounds a year to more
than two hundred million pounds a year.  The total university student
population is in excess of two hundred thousand, and teaching and
research staff number approximately twenty-five thousand.
