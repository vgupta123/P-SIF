the transverse potential flow past a body of revolution .
  it is shown that in the potential flow of
an incompressible inviscid fluid past a
body of revolution set with its axis at right
angles to the stream, the velocity
components at the surface along and perpendicular
to the meridians vary with azimuthal
angle round the body in a simple manner .
this is shown by entirely elementary
considerations .
