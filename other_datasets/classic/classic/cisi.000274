Question-Negotiation and Information Seeking in Libraries
   Seekers of information in libraries either go through a librarian 
intermediary or they help themselves.. When they go through librarians they 
must develop their questions through four levels of need, referred to here as 
the visceral, conscious, formalized, and compromised needs.. In this pre-search
interview with an information-seeker the reference librarian attempts to help
him arrive at an understanding od his "compromised" need by determining: (1) 
the subject of his interest; (2) his motivation; (3) his personal 
characteristics; (4) the relationship of the inquiry to file organization; 
and (5) anticipated answers.. The author contends that research is needed into
the techniques of conducting this negotiation between the user and the 
reference librarian..
