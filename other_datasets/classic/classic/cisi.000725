An Inquiry on New Forms of Primary Publications
  Some of the problems associated with present journal publications practices 
are discussed.  These are attributed to the fact that as the literature has
expanded, the needs of both authors and readers are no longer being met by
printing and distributing all of the material accepted to all subscribers.
A two-edition system is proposed, with short versions of papers in a broad
circulation issue and expanded versions, including full details and discussion, 
in library-circulation microfilm editions.  Reactions of chemists to such
a system are discussed.  It is recommended that two-edition journals be
developed in a evolutionary way by increasing use of the ACS mcirofilm 
editions for sections of articles and for supplementary documents to accompany
communications.
