The Design of Inquiring Systems
  "Design" is used throughout in its most generic sense,
to include planning, operations research, engineering design,
architectural design, programming, budgeting, and all the other
activities in which we consciously attempt to change ourselves and our
environment to improve the quality of our lives.  So the book could be
read as a philosophy of organization theory, or of architectural or
engineering design, or of operations research, or of planning.
  The word "inquiry" suggests that the audience includes persons
interested in the philosophy of science; this is true, so long as the
interest is a very broad one, concerned with the meaning of science with
respect to other social institutions, health, education, morality, and so
on.  Inquiry is by no means restricted to the disciplines of science.  I
could have called the book The Design of Systems, but this would not
adequately reflect my style, which is to proceed from the more specific
problem of inquiry to the "whole system."
