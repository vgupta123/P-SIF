natural frequencies of rectangular plates with edges
elastically restrained against rotation .
  plates with attachments to heavier members along the
edges can be described as having edges elastically restrained
against rotation, in many cases uniformly along each edge .  at
the edges, setting slope, when is the edge bending
moment with always positive, the elastic restraint can be
analytically defined with describing respectively,
clamped and simply supported edges .  in this note natural
frequencies of such plates are calculated mainly following the
nomenclature of dana young .
