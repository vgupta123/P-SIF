Education Related to the Use of Computers in Organizations
The ACM Curriculum Committee on Computer Education
for Management has been carrying out a study 
on "Curriculum Development in Management Information
Systems Education in Colleges and Universities" 
under a grant from the National Science Foundation.
 This position paper provides a framework for the 
study.  Preliminary conclusions are presented on the
need for education in administrative information 
systems, and appropriate college curricula and courses
are suggested.  Also, the role of professional 
societies and organizations using computers is discussed,
and the plans of the Committee are outlined. 
 The initial approach of the Committee has been to describe
the education necessary for the effective 
use of computers in organizations, to classify the
positions for which education is required, and to 
survey educational programs now available.
