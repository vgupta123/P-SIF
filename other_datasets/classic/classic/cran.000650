some design problems of hovercraft .
analysis of the influence various aerodynamic parameters have on
the performance of a simple peripheral jet system .  power weight
ratio, lift drag ratio, and effect of jet angles and thickness are
each considered .  structural requirements, optimum cushion
pressure, and dynamic stability over waves are examined and then
related to the economics of ground-effect machine operation .
