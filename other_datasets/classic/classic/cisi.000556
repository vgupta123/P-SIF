Introduction to Subject Indexing; a Programmed Text
  This programmed text has been developed from work initially carried out
under a research project funded by the Office for Scientific and Technical
Information (now the British Library Research and Development
Department).  The project, designed to investigate the applicability of the
techniques of programmed instruction in the teaching of practical subject
indexing, was conducted at the School of Librarianship, the Polytechnic
of North London in cooperation with the College of Librarianship Wales.
The programmed instruction course, written during this project and used
by students at both Schools of Librarianship, forms the basis of the
programmed text.
  Most of the existing programmed texts relevant to the field of practical
subject indexing are concerned with the translation stage of indexing and
aim to impart skills in the use of particular indexing languages.  Our
intention, in the above-mentioned project, was to produce a course of
programmed instruction which presented an integrated view of the basic
principles and practices of subject indexing rather than attempting to 
impart to the student a high degree of familiarity with any particular
system.
