Representation of Many-Sided Polygons
and Polygonal Lines for Rapid Processing
A representation for polygons and polygonal
lines is described which allows sets of consecutive 
sides to be collectively examined.  The set of sides are
arranged in a binary tree hierarchy by inclusion. 
 A fast algorithm for testing the inclusion of a poin t
in a many-sided polygon is given.  The speed of 
the algorithm is discussed for both ideal and practical
examples.  It is shown that the poin ts of intersection 
of two polygonal lines can be located by what is essentially
a binary tree search.  The algorithm and 
a practical example are discussed.  The representation
overcomes many of the disadvantages associated 
with the various fixed-grid methods for representing curves and regions
