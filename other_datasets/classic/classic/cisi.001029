A Little Commonwealth Family Life in Plymouth Colony
  The kind of study presented in this monograph has not as yet
won a wide following among working historians.  On the whole
their interest has remained with the larger units of social
action: the region, the class, the party, the ethnic or religious
group.  It has been left to the so-called behavioral sciences -
anthropology, sociology, psychology - to demonstrate the fundamental
importance of the smallest and most intimate of all group environments,
the family.
