the applicability of individualized programed instruction
in the education of deaf children.
verbal behavior is learned behavior and as
such is guided by the same principles
as any other learned behavior.  the parents'
role is mainly to help the young deaf
child conceive of language as a socializing
process and to help shape language behavior
toward the use of verbal symbols.
the teacher's role in the deaf child's
progress as a language user includes (1) helping
the child discover how the structure
of his language operates and (2) guiding
him in the process of acquiring clear
concepts.  the learning of a language is a highly
individualized process and requires
thousands of hours of practice.  efficiency
in language teaching to the deaf
has not been generally achieved by traditional
methods.  the teacher of the deaf
needs extra help in order to provide the individualistic
kind of teaching to insure
verbal over-learning by the child.  self-tutoring
programed materials offer this
help.  programs are so constructed that a child
proceeds through the program step
by step with a probability of maximum success
because of constant feedback as to
correctness of his responses.  for younger
children the use of a machine seems
desirable while for older children the program
may appear in book form, on film
strip, and any other visual medium.  well constructed
programs should be correlated
with classroom instruction.
