Sampling and Short-Period Usage in the Purdue Library
   Several possible methods of sampling of social science monograph titles in 
the general library of Purdue University were considered, and a "good" method
was used to obtain estimates of their usage in the library and at home during 
the period July 1 - August 4, 1964.. The term relative usage was defined and 
used to study the effect of: (1) language, (2) country of publication, (3) 
year of publication, and (4) year of accession of a monograph title.. An 
attempt was made to fit a regression model for titles in English by quantifying
the last three independent variables with relative usage as the dependent 
variable.. Functions based on the above variables have been developed to 
identify monograph titles for storage..
   A questionnaire was employed to stady the usage of library facilities and to 
gather opinions of library patrons.. Purpose of visiting the library, reason 
for checkout of library material, reason for preferring library or home for the 
use of library material, etc., were analyzed on the basis of the replies 
received..
