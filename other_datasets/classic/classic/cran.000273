flow past slender blunt bodies - a review and extension .
  a numerical solution of the inviscid flow field about slender blunt
bodies of revolution has been developed through a combination of two
methods ..  the van dyke solution in the subsonic flow
region at the nose, and the method of
characteristics in the supersonic region .
the results are compared with
second-order blast wave theory and with experimental
data,. and the respective merits and
deficiencies of the two theoretical methods
are pointed out .  the results of the
numerical solution are further used in a
discussion of the entropy layer, to
propose a possible criterion of entropy layer thickness .
