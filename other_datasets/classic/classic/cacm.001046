A Compiler-Building System Developed by Brooker and Morris
In a number of articles published during the
past two years, R. A. Brooker and D. Morris (joined 
by J.S. Rohl in their most recent paper have presented
a very interesting programming system that they 
have developed for the Ferranti Atlas computer.  The
present paper describes some of the major features 
of their system. it expands on some points that the original
authors cover briefly, and treats only very 
lightly some topics to which they devote considerable space.
 The purpose of this paper is purely expository. 
 Except in some very small details, and in some comments,
it does not intentionally depart from or add 
to the material published in the listed references.
