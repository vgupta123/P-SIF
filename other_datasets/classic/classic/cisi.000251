Carl H. Milam and the American Library Association
  Carl Hastings Milam spent the most productive years of his life in
the positions with which his name is most closely associated, those
of secretary and, later, executive secretary of the American
Library Association (ALA) from 1920 to 1948.  When he became
secretary, the association had already been in existence for forty-
four years.  What kind of association was it that claimed Milam's
allegiance? What experience had he had with ALA before becoming
its secretary?  The answers to these questions lead to better
understanding of Milam, the association, and their close relationship.
