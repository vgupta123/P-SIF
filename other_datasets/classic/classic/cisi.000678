A Chemical Notation and Code for Computer Manipulation
  This paper describes and specifies the rules for generating a code to 
represent chemical formulas.  It may be used either as a notation or for 
internal manipulation by computer for registration, screening, and atom-by-
atom search.  It is basically a connection table in a concise format which also
contains abnormality information relating to specific atoms or relations 
between atoms.  The notation produced by these rules unambiguously defines
a structure (as a connection table), but the notation is unique only to a
given numbering (or citation order) of the atoms.  Hence, its uniqueness is
dependent on the numbering uniqueness of the atoms in the structural formula.
Techniques for the use of the code in registry and substructure search are
also discussed.
