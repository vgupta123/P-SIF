Communication Patterns in Applied Technology
  The preceding papers have addressed themselves
to the study of information flow in a particular
stream of human activity which has been variously called
science, pure science, basic research, or
fundamental research, and which
is only secondarily, if at all, concerned
with the practical utilization of its products.
At this point it is appropriate to note that there is
a parallel activity which includes applied research,
exploratory development, and engineering development.
This second stream of research we will call technology.
Far more is known about the flow of information
among scientists than among technologists.  From
the knowledge that is available, however, we are
led to conclude that the communication patterns  
in the two areas of activity are not only largely
independent of one another, but qualitatively
different in their nature.  This difference is
reflected most clearly in the mechanisms by
which information is diffused within the two
sets of practitioners.  The present paper is
addressed to these differences and to a discussion
of the nature of the communication process between
science and technology.
