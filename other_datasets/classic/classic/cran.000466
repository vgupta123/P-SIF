development of the vapour screen method of flow
visualization in the 3ft tunnel at rae bedford.
  the vapour screen method of flow visualisation in supersonic wind
tunnels is outlined, and the development of a suitable technique for use
in the 3 ft tunnel described, together with the associated optical and
photographic equipment .
  the results of tests to determine the humidity required to produce an
optimum density of fog in the working section over the mach number range
temperature discussed .  numerous vapour screen photographs of the flow
over and behind delta wings are included and some comparisons made with
the corresponding surface oil-flow patterns .
  the process of condensation, the physical and optical properties of
the resulting fog, and the formation of the vapour screen picture are
all considered in some detail .
  the effects of humidity on the mach number and static pressure in the
working section were investigated and the results are compared with
theoretical estimates at a nominal mach number of 2.0 .  it is shown
that the adverse effects of condensation on the flow at high mach
numbers may be alleviated by the use of liquids with a lower latent heat
of evaporation than water, and some results obtained at a mach number of
  the possibility of extending the vapour screen technique to transonic
and subsonic speeds is also considered, and some results obtained at a
mach number of 0.85 are included .
