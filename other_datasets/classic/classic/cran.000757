an investigation of the flow about a plane half-wing
of cropped delta planform and 6( symmetrical section
at stream mach numbers between 0. 8 and 1. 41 .
  a study has been made of the flow development
over the wing as the incidence and stream
mach number vary and this is illustrated by surface pressure
distributions and oil-flow patterns .  the growth
and movement of the two main surface shocks (the rear and
forward shocks) is discussed, and conditions for
flow separation through these shocks are considered .  for
the rear shock, which has little sweep, these
conditions are similar to those for shock-induced separation
on two-dimensional aerofoils .  the forward
shock is comparatively highly swept and separation seems
to correspond to two rather different but
simultaneously-attained conditions, one related to the
component mach number normal to the shock front
and the other to the position of the reattachment line .
  the flow in the region between the leading edge and
the forward shock is shown to have certain characteristics
analogous to those found upstream of the shock on
two-dimensional aerofoils .  to the rear of the forward
shock, but ahead of the rear shock, the flow at low
supersonic speeds resembles in some respects that about
a simple cone .
  the general flow development is related in the
text to the wing lift and pitching moment, and the drag .
the first two are most affected by the aft movement
of the rear shock, which also stimulates the transonic
drag rise .  the lift-dependent drag is shown to be
influenced by the appearance of leading-edge separation
and possibly also by some stage in the development
of the forward shock .
  the flow over the cropped-delta planform is
noteworthy for the absence of the strong outboard shock
and this is attributed partly to the cropped tip and
partly to the unswept trailing edge .  a comparison is made
with results obtained during preliminary tests in
which the wing planform closely resembled that of a true
delta .
