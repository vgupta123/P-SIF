Indexing Language Structure for Automated Retrieval
   A proposal for a computer-aided method of building up an indexing language 
is made.. The method involves linking the terms relevant to any special 
retrieval system into the UDC, preferably in the form of the Standard Reference
Code when it becomes available.. Links between the terms are intended to be 
established in such a way that, provided indexing input sessions are 
accomplished via a video terminal, a hybrid thesaurus-classification could be 
built up by a form of "learning process" in the course of regular indexing.. 
The proposed means of establishing links between terms are described, the
associated computer system is outlined, and an example of indexing language
built-up procedure is presented.. Possible uses for natural language search, 
using the thesaurus-classification as a "switching language", and for automatic
classification, are suggested as long-term aims..
