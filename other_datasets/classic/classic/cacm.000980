Multiple-Precision Arithmetic and the Exact
Calculation of the 3-j, 6-j and 9-j Symbols
Described in this paper is a system of general-purpose
multiple-precision fixed-point routines 
and their use in subroutines which calculate exactly
the quantum-mechanical 3-j, 6-j and 9-j symbols 
of large arguments.
