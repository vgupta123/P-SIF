freeman method .
the freeman method (ref. 26) is similar to
chester's method in that the newtonian-plus-centrifugal solution (eq.
with the von mises transformation .  a method of successive
approximations is applied to both plane and axially symmetric blunt-nosed bodies
for small and infinite free-stream mach number .
formulas for the streamlines, shock shape, and pressure distribution are
determined to this approximation .  a number of special shapes are
treated in ref. 26, and in certain cases the theory has a singular point
where the first approximation to the pressure vanishes., that is,
for a sphere (see eq. 7-113) .  as in chester's method, the theory is
not applicable where the pressure becomes too small .
