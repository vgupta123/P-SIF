User Circulation Satisfaction vs. Size of Holdings at Three Academic 
Libraries
   In an effort to determine certain facts concerning the relation of 
circulation satisfaction to collection size, the author sampled the "last 
circulation date" of stack books and of circulated books in three considerably 
different kinds of academic libraries.. The experience of these three libraries 
proved to be surprisingly similar.. The author speculates concerning potential 
uses to which such data might be profitably applied..
