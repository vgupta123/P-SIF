Key Factors of Circulation System Analysis and Design
   Librarians must frequently judge circulation systems on the basis of widely 
disparate descriptions that make comparisons difficult.. A way is needed to 
place  various systems into a common perspective framework, so that their 
similarities and differences can be readily understood.. This paper explains 
basic (and largely familiar) concepts and components that are common to manual,
machine-aided, and computer-based systems, and documents their significance as 
key factors in the analysis and design of academic library circulation systems..
Cost factors are not discussed..
