Decision Analysis:  Introductory Lectures on Choices Under Uncertainty
  These lectures do not present a descriptive theory of actual behavior.
Neither do they present a positive theory of behavior for a superintelligent,
fictitious being; nowhere in our analysis shall we refer to the behavior of an
"idealized, rational, and economic man," a man who always acts in a perfectly
consistent manner as if somehow there were embedded in his nature a coherent
set of evaluation patterns that cover any and all eventualities.  Rather, the
approach we take prescribes how an individual who is faced with a problem of
choice under uncertainty should go about choosing a course of action that is
consistent with his personal basic judgements and preferences.  He must
consciously police the consistency of his subjective inputs and calculate
their implications for action.  Such an approach is designed to help us reason
and act a bit more systematically - when we choose to do so!
