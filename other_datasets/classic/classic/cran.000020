  author generalizes lees's (amr 10(1957), rev. 2601)
modification of newtonian theory for blunt-nose bodies to apply to pointed-
nose bodies as well .  the result is expressed by
sin where is the local inclination of the body
surface and the subscript /max/ refers to the maximum local
inclination and pressure coefficient .  for blunt-nose bodies
and the generalized theory reverts to lees's blunt-nose
modification with given by normal shock relations .  author shows,
by comparison of newtonian and generalized-newtonian theory
with exact solutions, the superiority of generalized-newtonian
theory .  he also shows that both two-dimensional and
axisymmetric shapes are correlated by this generalization .  results are
presented in two figures that support author's generalization and
indicate the independence of the correlation from variations in
both the hypersonic similarity parameter k = m(d1) and the ratio
of specific heats y .
  reviewer believes this generalization should be of interest to
those engaged in development of hypersonic hardware as well as
theory .
