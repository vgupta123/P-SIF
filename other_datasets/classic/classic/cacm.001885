A Computer System for Transformational Grammar
A comprehensive system for transformational
grammar has been designed and implemented on the 
IBM 360/67 computer.  The system deals with the transformational
model of syntax, along the lines of 
Chomsky's Aspects of the Theory of Syntax. The major
innovations include a full,formal description of 
the syntax of a transformational grammar, a directed random
phrase structure generator, a lexical insertion 
algorithm, an extended definition of analysis, and
a simple problem-oriented programming language in 
which the algorithm for application of transformations
can be expressed.  In this paper we present the 
system as a whole, first discussing the general attitudes underlying
the development of the system, then 
outlining the system and discussing its more important
special features.  References are given to papers 
which consider some particular aspect of the system in detail.
