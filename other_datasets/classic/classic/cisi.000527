A Technique for Machine-Aided Indexing
   Subject indexing of text can, in principle, be accomplished in many ways.. 
The technique for machine-aided indexing (MAI) developed at the Defense 
Documentation Center (DDC) is illustrated on a randomly chosen abstract..
Additional text is provided in coded form so that the reader can more fully
explore this technique and form his own opinion of the applicability and 
versatility of this particular procedure.. The DDC method for subject indexing 
is very close to operational status for a data base which grows at the rate of 
two million words of text per year..
