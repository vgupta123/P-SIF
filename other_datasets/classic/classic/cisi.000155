Subject Relations in Science/Technology Literature
  The analysis of citations has often been employed to indicate the use
of the literature of science and technology.  Citation is only an indicator
of use, not an accurate measure, and like all such indicators has defects.
Differences between indicators have been discussed elsewhere.
  Despite these defects, an examination of citations does enable one to
sample acts of literature use within a large community.  The study reported
here was directed, in fact, to all United Kingdom authors of science/
technology publications in a given year, and because of its width, and the type
of analysis performed, is considered to be worth reporting.  The study was
primarily undertaken to obtain comparable information about social science
literature, and this has been reported elsewhere.
