autopathy:follow-up of cases
the publication of two papers
recently in the acta paedopsychiatrica by
d. arn. van krevelen on the subject of "autistic
psychopathy", has stimulated the author
to present 5 cases which appear to conform to
his description.  the only value of this brief
contribution lies in the fact that they have all
been followed up for at least 10 years, and
this may give some idea of the eventual results
in this type of cases.
