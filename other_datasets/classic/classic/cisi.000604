Comparison of Document Data Bases
   This paper presents a detailed analysis of the content and format of seven
machine-readable bibliographic data bases: Chemical Abstract Service 
Condensates, Chemical and Biological Activities, and Polymer Science and
Technology, Biosciences Information Service's BA Previews including Biological
Abstracts and BioReseach Index, Institute for Science Information Source Tape, 
and Engineering Index COMPENDEX..
   Selected issue test tapes of each data base were printed and checked for the
types of data that were contained in the issue and the methods in which the 
data were formatted.. This paper compared the physical formats of the tapes and
describes the varied treatments given to such data elements as authors, titles, 
abstracts, etc.. Comparison of data bases requires common use of terms.. All
terms are defined at the beginning of the paper..
   The authors found great discrepancies in the presentation of essentially 
similar bibliographic data, and they offer some suggestions for mitigating the 
discrepancies by use of standards..
