Optimization of Expressions in Fortran
A method of optimizing the computation of
arithmetic and indexing expressions of a Fortran 
program is presented.  The method is based on a linear
analysis of the definition points of the variables 
and the branching and DO loop structure of the program.
 The objectives of the processing are (1) to 
eliminate redundant calculations when references are
made to common subexpression values, (2) to remove 
invariant calculations from DO loops, (3) to efficiently
compute subscripts containing DO iteration variables, 
and (4) to provide efficient index register usage.  The
method presented requires at least a three-pass 
compiler, the second of which is scanned backward.  It
has been used in the development of several FORTRAN 
compilers that have proved to produce excellent object
code without significantly reducing the compilation 
speed.
