User's Reaction to Microfiche A Preliminary Study
   Recent emphasis placed on the use of microfiche  by large government agencies
has increased the pressure in libraries supporting government research to make
greater use of microfiche.. Negative and apathetic user attitudes, expressed by
researchers, indicate that expanded efforts to overcome resistance if the great 
potential of microfiche is to be realized.. Efforts in microphotography, 
expended on technical achievement in the past, should be directed toward
understanding the user and his needs to discover why he avoids microforms and
how to overcome his resistance to them..
