part iii - calibration of the flow in the working section .
the fused silica nozzle to give m=7 in the 7 in. x 7 in. hypersonic
wind tunnel produces a flow field with an average mach number of 6.85
along the centreline of the working section .  the mach number gradually
decreases towards the boundary layer, and over a core of approximately
mach number .
the nozzle heats up during a run but this has little effect on the
mach number distribution .  at one station the mach number was one-third
per cent greater for a run of 1 minute than for a run of 10 seconds .
the temperature field in the inviscid flow has an average variation of
in temperature with time throughout a run .
