Interaction Between Requesters and a Large Mechanized retrieval System
   In a large mechanized retrieval system, a certain proportion of the search
failures are likely to be directly attributable to inadequate user-system 
interaction.. Request statements may be only distant  approximations of
actual information requirements.. This paper discusses some of the problems of
the user-system interface and suggests methods whereby these problems may be
alleviated..
