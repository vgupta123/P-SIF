A Model for a Multifunctional Teaching System
A teaching system model that was incorporated
into an operating system of a large computer 
is described.  The model transferred control to the
operating system to execute functions other than 
teaching, and then recovered control in order to resume
teaching.  The teaching system (ABAC-II) was 
written to run under the operating system (IBSYS) for
the IBM 7044 Graphic System.  Because the teaching 
system automatically terminated and rescheduled itself,
a student studying a course presented at a cathode-ray 
display terminal could switch readily between student
mode and programmer mode.  During the latter, the 
full resources of the operating system (language processors,
compilers, library and user's programs) 
were at his disposal.  He could for example, write, assemble,
debug, and execute at the terminal a program 
written in any language processed by the operating system.
 A course could therefore include text material 
interleaved with programming problems which the student
could solve without leaving the terminal.  Exercises 
in simulation and gaming could also be provided.  The
implications of a teaching system with this degree 
of flexibility for industrial and executive training
as well as academic education are discussed.  In 
addition, the advantages of this type of system for computer
programming and operation are also considered.
