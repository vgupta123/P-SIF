1172. studies on selenium toxicity and chondroitin sulfate and taurine
biosynthesis in the chick embryo
fourteen-day-old chick embryos were used in in vivo experiments.  a toxic
selenite treatment did not cause a reduction in the extent of sulfate-s
incorporation into chondroitin sulfate or into taurine or a reduction in the
observed tissue levels of these metabolites.  rather, the taurine level was
significantly greater with the embryos which received selenium.  the extent of
the incorporation of selenite-se into the metabolites was low or not
significant.
