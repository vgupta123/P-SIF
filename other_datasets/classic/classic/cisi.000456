Information and Its User
  In science and technology user studies are numerous and have a
history of some twenty years.  The relevance of the methodology
of science user studies to the social sciences is considered in 
Chapter 2.  The pressing need in user studies, in science as well
as social science, is for a general body of theory about the flow
of information in research and teaching communities.  Some of the
fundamental characteristics of social science research and its
literature which have a bearing upon investigations of information
needs and requirements are considered in the first part of Chapter
3, and the second part is devoted to a review of empirical studies
in the social sciences.  Other relevant material about the use made
of information is discussed in Chapter 4 on systematic approaches.
