real gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds .
real gas effects in flow over blunt bodies at hypersonic speeds .
a hypersonic shock tunnel has been developed to investigate the
aerodynamic characteristics of flow over bodies at conditions comparable to
those encountered by ballistic missiles and satellites re-entering the
atmosphere . some results for a shock velocity of over 50,000 ft. per
sec. in the shock tube portion of the facility are presented . static
pressure investigations were made in the nozzle to determine the flow
condition and the expansion process .
the results of the investigation of representative blunt bodies at
hypersonic mach numbers and nozzle stagnation temperatures up to
approximately 6,000degreek. are presented . these include body pressure
distributions, shock-wave shapes, detachment distances, and photographs
of the luminous gas region in the shock layer . it is seen that the
shock detachment distance is smaller at higher stagnation temperatures
due to the real gas effects . for the hemisphere the pressure
distribution was less than that predicted by the modified newtonian theory for
 all stagnation temperatures . for a 50degree cone-hemisphere the
pressure distribution and the shock detachment distance were appreciably
affected by the real gas effects .
the observed shock-wave shape and the approximate boundary layer on a
flat plate are compared with the analytical prediction . some
preliminary results for the detached shock wave produced by a blunt two-
dimensional body in a low density flow at a mach number of 19.6 are presented
