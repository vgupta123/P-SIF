the newtonian theory of impact has been shown to be
useful for pressure calculations on the forward facing part
of bodies moving at high speed .  it is now a familiar practice
to use this information to calculate nonviscous velocities at the
wall and then to estimate rates of heat transfer .  this
procedure is perhaps open to question,. heat-transfer rates depend
on velocity gradients which are not given by the newtonian
analysis .  nor can one obtain information on boundary-layer
stability or all the body stability derivatives .  it seems,
therefore, inevitable that, as design proceeds with these hypersonic
missiles, there will be a greater need for more accurate
aerodynamic theories either to predict what will happen in unfamiliar
flight conditions or to effect an extrapolation from a known test
result to the design condition .
