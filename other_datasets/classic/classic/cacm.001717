Generating Prime Implicants Via Ternary Encoding and Decimal Arithmetic
Decimal arithmetic, ternary encoding of cubes,
and topological considerations are used in an 
algorithm to obtain the extremals and prime implicants
of Boolean functions. The algorithm, which has 
been programmed in the FORTRAN language, generally requires
less memory than other minimization procedures, 
and treats DON'T CARE terms in an efficient manner.
