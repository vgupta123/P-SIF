spiramycin in the treatment of experimental
mycoplasmosis in day-old chicks and turkey
poults
day-old chicks and turkey poults experimentally infected with
m. gallisepticum have been treated at the time of infection, with
spiramycin administered by subcutaneous injection or drinking water
medication.
a dose of 100 mg/kg. bodyweight by subcutaneous injection or an
0.04 per cent. concentration in the drinking water continuously for
three days eliminated the infection in most of the birds, which
remained free of air-sac lesions and did not react to the slide agg-
lutination or haemagglutination inhibition tests.
