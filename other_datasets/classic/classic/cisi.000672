Esso Research Experiences with Chemical Abstracts on Microfilm
  Late in 1964, The Chemical Abstracts Service announced
that in 1965 it would lease Chemical Abstracts in microfilm
form to subscribers to its current printed abstracts.  With
this move, microfilm entered a new stage - use in technical-
information work as a publication medium for frequently
employed tools rather than for largely archival documents.
