the buckling strength of a uniform circular cylinder
loaded in axial compression .
  the theoretical estimation of the buckling strength of a cylinder
loaded in axial compression is improved by the use of a more
representative deflected form for the buckled cylinder than has
previously been used .  kempner's buckling strength for dead weight
loading is reduced by 18 .  the presentation of the magnitude and
distribution of the constraint system required to maintain the mode is
novel and instructive .
