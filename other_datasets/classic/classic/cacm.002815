High-Level Binding with Low-Level Linkers
An easy to implement scheme is described by
which a compiler can enforce agreement between 
complex data types in separately compiled modules.
 The scheme is designed to work with any existing 
link editor or linking loader, no matter how deficient.
 Obscure run-time errors caused by inconsistent 
usages are forestalled by static errors detected at linking time.
