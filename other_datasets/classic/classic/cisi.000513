Communication and Information Processing within Scientific Disciplines:
Empirical Findings for Psychology
   Scientific disciplines can be regarded as social devices which have, as one
function, the analysis and reduction of raw information to assimilated 
knowledge of a type which can be transmitted through professional training..
Data on information flow in psychology reveal feedback to scientific workers
and result in refinements of the product of research; later disseminations are 
interwoven with processes of evaluation and selection and are directed toward 
the creation of an integrated and tested body of knowledge.. The reported data 
finish an empirical base for Ziman's consensual model of science and illuminate 
difficulties which have arisen in the design and implementation of information 
systems..
