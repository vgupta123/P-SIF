Toward an Automata Theory of Brains
A source of ideas for automata theory-the study
of the brain-has been pushed aside in mathematical 
development of the theory.  This paper suggests the ways
in which automata theory might evolve over the 
next 25 years if it is to contribute to an understanding
of how the brain processes information.
