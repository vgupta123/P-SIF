A Core Nursing Library for Practitioners
The following books and journals
for the Core Nursing Library,
suggested reference materials,
and supplementary books and journals
were selected by experts in nursing
from all parts of the United States.
The purpose is to let practitioners
and community hospitals
know which books and journals,
from a wealth of printed material
would, in the opinion of experts, be
most useful, especially where funds
and space are limited.
