Semantic Clustering of Index Terms
   A computer procedure to recognize indexing vocabularies is described..Index
terms are drawn from the vocabulary of a structured indexing system and may
consist of single words, collection of words, or syntactic phrases.. The basic
idea is that a measure of the semantic association between index terms can be 
determined from the structural relationships which the terms exhibit by their
relative positions in the system.. The association measure, which is based on a 
priori (preassigned) semantic relationships between terms, rather than their 
co-occurrence in a document corpus, is then for grouping index terms into 
clusters or concepts.. Some results of an experimental investigation are 
presented..
