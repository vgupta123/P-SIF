the relation between wall temperature and the effect
of roughness on boundary layer transition .
the experimentally demonstrated rise and subsequent
fall of transition reynolds number with decreasing wall-
to-ambient temperature ratio has been the subject of two recent
notes .  in both cases it was argued that the increased
effectiveness of roughness due to wall cooling was not sufficient to
explain the transition-reversal phenomenon on nominally smooth
bodies .  in one case, the criterion for transition reversal was
taken to be and in the other values of as low as
eter is a reynolds number formed from velocity and
kinematic viscosity based on calculated conditions at the height of
roughness element k in the undisturbed, laminar boundary layer
at the station of roughness location .  the present note is
submitted to show that another method for evaluating the effect
of roughness on transition leads to an opposite conclusion .
