Measuring Readers' Failure at the Shelf in Three University Libraries
   This paper continues the reporting of the Unit's work on a method of 
investigating how often readers fail to find what they are looking for on the 
shelves, why they fail, and what particular books they fail to find..
   The method used is a slight modification of the earlier one - readers were
asked to record on a slip provided the details of the book or periodical they
were looking for, or subject area they were looking in, their academic status,
and the date, and then to place the slip in an adjoining box.. Fron analysis of
these 'failure' slips it was possible to determine the cause of the reader's
failure, the individual book the reader was looking for, and the pattern of
failure for different groups of volumes..
  A new development was surveys of samples of readers, carried out during the
fortnight of peak demand.. Answers to these surveys provided information on the
effect or failure on a reader's work, what action he took after failing, whether
he found adequate substitutes, how many books he found by browsing, and what
proportion of the books he consulted he borrowed.. Some of these answers could be
checked by a direct count of the books used in, and borrowed from, the library..
   The investigations were carried out in three University libraries, each with 
its own characteristic library structure and teaching patterns.. These 
differences were reflected in the results obtained..
   It is hoped that the methods of investigation used can be employed by 
librarians to investigate the effectiveness of some of the services in their own
libraries..
