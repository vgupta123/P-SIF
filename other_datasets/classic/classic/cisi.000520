CA Condensates as a Retrospective Search Tool	A Commentary
   A retrospective test search on 1 year of CA Condensates was carried out in 
order to calculate the cost per profile and to get an impression of how CA 
Condensates would suffice as a database for a retrospective use.. Some means of
improving the search strategy by means of the CAS Standard Distribution Format
were investigated.. The question is raised whether the costs and efforts 
presently devoted to research regarding retrospective searches on large 
free-text databases are justified in view of the low average precision ratios 
generally observed for free text databases and the very high number of 
references of potential interest retrieved..
