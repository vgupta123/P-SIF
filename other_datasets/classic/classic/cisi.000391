Factors in the Transfer of Technology
  The strong correlation between the scope and depth of this country's
research and development activities and the vigor and the growth of its
industrial plant is today a widely accepted fact.  Government expenditures
for research and development have increased from a modest
annual rate of $200 million some thirty years ago to $17 billion today.
The research budgets of the private sector of the economy, which were
almost miniscule in the 1930's, total approximately $8 billion today.
These expenditures have had their many tangible and visible results,
ranging from nylon and antibiotics to radar and solid state electronics,
but what is not so generally appreciated is the additional product
represented by the increasing inventory of ideas and new knowledge
whose application, for the most part, is still a potential one.  The
sophisticated and often urgent nature of some of the larger products in
which we engage today, which require vast research expenditures to
find the efficient way, or the economical way, or the safe way, or the
most accurate way to accomplish some end purpose, also produces an
increase in the national level of scientific and technological competence
that has not yet been transferred into the civilian economy.  The
value of the technical ideas now stored and awaiting application can
be estimated as a value many times larger than the annual rate of
billions of dollars invested in the effort it took to develop this increased
technical capability.  As a national resource for underwriting further
economic and industrial development, this technical inventory is a
factor of major importance.
