response of a serum glycoprotein to tissue injury
and necrosis
1. the response to necrosis, hyperplasia and tumour growth
a serum glycoprotein of the rat underwent a 20-fold increase during 15 days
growth of the walker tumour and this increase was not affected when the rats
were treated with terramycin.  the protein increased at the same or a greater
rate when rats were subjected to ischaemic necrosis of one kidney or of two-
thirds of the liver.  boiled kidney tissue, on the other hand, had little
effect upon the protein response, and kidney hyperplasia had none.  it is
suggested that this protein increase is a response to substances liberated from
damaged or necrotic cells.
