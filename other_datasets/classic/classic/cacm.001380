SIMULA-an ALGOL-Based Simulation Language
This paper is an introduction to SIMULA, a
programming language designed to provide a systems 
analyst with unified concepts which facilitate the
concise description of discrete event systems.  A 
system description also serves as a source language simulation
program.  SIMULA is an extension of ALGOL 
60 in which the most important new concepts
is that of quasi-parallel processing.
