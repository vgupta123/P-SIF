two dimensional transonic flow past airfoils .
  this report concerns the problem of constructing solutions for
transonic flows over symmetric airfoils .  the aspect of the problem
emphasized is, of necessity, not how to form a solution for compressible
flow but how to simplify the initial phase of the problem, namely, the
mapping of the incompressible flow .  in the case of the symmetric
joukowski airfoil without circulation, the mapping is relatively simple,
but the coefficients in the power series are difficult to evaluate .  as
a result, the problem requires simplification .  instead of the exact
incompressible flow past the airfoil, an approximate flow is used, which
is derived from a combination of source and sink .  this flow differs
only slightly from the exact one when the thickness is small .  by the
same method, the flow with circulation is also considered .
  after the incompressible-flow functions are approximated in this
fashion, the numerical calculation of the corresponding compressible
flow, by the hodograph theory, does not present any
essential difficulty .
