User Assessment of Computer-Based Bibliographic Retrieval Services
  The academic users of the bibliographic information dissemination center
were surveyed to determine the ways in which the search results were being
used, the impact which the services had had on professional activities such
as research and instruction, the interface between the computer-based
retrieval and the traditional form of library resources, and the effect of
document overlap between different data bases.  The survey results indicate
that the dissemination services are being used by a large portion of the
faculty and the graduate students within the University System of Georgia,
with an average of 3 to 5 people seeing the bibliography from each search
question.  Over 97% of the respondees indicated some or substantial
contribution to their professional activities, with the major contributions 
being a savings or more efficient use of time and broadened subject
coverage.  The users indicated several changes in library use habits as a
result of the computer-based searches, among them more direct access to the
primary literature and increased use of library resources as they had been
made aware of new sources and media - e.g., microforms.  Percentage
responses on these and related topics are presented.
