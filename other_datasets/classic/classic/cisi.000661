Is Automatic Classification a Reasonable Application of Statistical
Analysis of Text?
   The statistical approach to the analysis of document collections and
retrieval therefrom has proceeded along two main lines, associative machine
searching and automatic classification.. The former approach has been
favored because of the tendency of people in the computer field to strive for
new methods of dealing with the literature--methods which do not resemble those
of traditional libraries.. But automatic classification study also has been
thriving; some of the reasons for this are discussed..
   The crucial question of the quality of automatic classification is treated
at considerable length, and empirical data are introduced  to support the
hypothesis that classification quality improves as more information about
each document is used for input to the classification program.. Six
nonjudgmental criteria are used in testing the hypothesis for 100
keyword lists (each list representing a document) for a series of computer
runs in which the number of words per document is increased progressively
from 12 to 36.. Four of the six criteria indicate the hypothesis holds, and
two point to no effect.. Previous work of this kind has been confined to the
range of one through eight words per document..
   Finally, the future of automatic classification and some of the practical
problems to be faced are outlined..
