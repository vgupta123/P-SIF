Some Cost Estimates for Bibliographical Searching in a Large-Scale
Social Sciences Information System
  Many of the large-scale mechanized information systems in operation today
grew up because of the need of the military and para-military establishments
to have rapid access to large quantities of scientific and technological
information.  This paper will deal with two complementary efforts in the
field of social sciences, where an awareness of the information problem is
acute, and the global needs staggering.  The target audiences for these two
systems are on the one hand social science researchers and on the other
policy planners and makers in the broad field of economic and social 
development.
  An operational system (in the International Labour Office) will be
described, and an array of figures representing actual or theoretical 
operating costs will be given.  As could be expected, however, these
figures relate only to costs of systems development, input preparation,
file maintenance and retrieval.  No attempt can be made to evaluate in other
than general terms the economic impact that the existence of such a system
may have.  It can be readily demonstrated, however, that computer-assisted
information systems may make sense within individual institutional
environments, and make greater sense when on-line systems linking
various collaborating institutions can result in enabling each to operate
more efficiently and at lower cost.  The existence of such on-line
networks would make the greatest sense for users because of the possibility
of having access at a reasonable price to large information stores.
