The Derivation and Application of the Bradford-Zipf Distribution
   Any statistical regularities found in documentation should be fully 
exploited to produce estimates or predictions and to save documentalists work..
But present formulations of the Bradford distribution demand penetrating search
for peripheral papers and tedious computation in application.. The present 
paper shows that the Bradford distribution is closely related to the Zipf
distribution.. It requires data on only the most productive journals, is
mathematically simple and amenable to graphical methods if a proposed idea of
the 'completeness' of a search is accepted.. For comparability of results, 
certain conditions, which include a specified minimum level of productivity of 
journals, need to be standardized.. A standard form is suggested..
   It is found, however, that a modified form of the Bradford distribution is 
required when Bradford-type collections of journals are merged into large
collections, when 'saturation' of the most productive journals occurs..
