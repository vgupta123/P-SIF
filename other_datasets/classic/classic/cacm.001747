Three Criteria for Designing Computing Systems to Facilitate Debugging
The designer of a computing system should adopt
explicit criteria for accepting or rejecting 
proposed system features.  Three possible criteria of this
kind are input recordability, input specifiability, 
and asynchronous reproducibility of output.  These criteria
imply that a user can, if he desires, either 
know or control all the influences affecting the content
and extent of his computer's output.  To define 
the scope of the criteria, the notion of an abstract
machine of a programming language and the notion 
of a virtual computer are explained.  Examples of applications
of the criteria concern the reading of 
a time-of-day clock,  the synchronization of parallel
processes, protection in multiprogrammed systems, 
and the assignment of capability indexes.
