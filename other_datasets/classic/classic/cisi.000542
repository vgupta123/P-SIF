(Towards a Theory of the Concept)
  A concept is regarded as the common element of
both classification systems and thesauri.  Reality
and knowledge are not represented by words or
terms but by the meanings "behind" these tokens.
A concept of, say, an object, a property of an
object, a process, etc. is derived from verbal 
statements on these as subjects and may therefore be
defined as the whole of true and possible predicates
that can be collected on a given subject.  It is
from these predicates that the characteristics of the
corresponding concepts can be derived.  Common
characteristics in different concepts lead to
relations between concepts, which relations in turn are
factors for the formation of concept systems.
Different kinds of relationships as well as different
kinds of concepts are distinguished.  It is pointed
out that an orderly supply of the elements for 
propositions (information statements) on new knowledge
requires the construction and availability of such
concept systems.
