An Experimental Model of System/360
The problem of predicting the performance of
modern computer systems is formidable.  One general 
technique which can ease this problem is macroscopic simulation.
 This paper reports on the applicability 
of that technique to System/360.  The paper describes
an experimental model of System/360-its hardware, 
software, and its environment.  The measures of system performance
produced by the model consist of statistics 
relating to turnaround time, throughput, hardware utilization,
software utilization, and queueing processes. 
 The model is mechanized in SIMSCRIPT and consists of
some 1750 statements.  An auxiliary programs, the 
Job Generator, creates automatically the properties
of System/360 jobs that get simulated.
