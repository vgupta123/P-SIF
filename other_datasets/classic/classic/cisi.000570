Deriving Term Relations for a Corpus by Graph Theoretical Clusters
  We discuss how alternative methods of automatic
term clustering may provide insight into how terms are
related within a corpus.  The work reported uses a
corpus of 2267 documents that contain 3950 index
terms.	A similarity matrix is developed using the
document - term matrix.  A threshold level T is applied to
the similarity matrix.  Entries in the matrix that are
greater than or equal to the threshold level are set
equal to one, and the remaining entries are set to zero.
  Three definitions are applied to the corresponding
graph of each threshold matrix to develop clusters.
These are, (1) the connected components of the graph,
(2) the maximal complete subgraphs of the graph, and
(3) the combined maximal complete subgraphs of the
graph as described that show how insight may be
gained into the term relations by varying the threshold
levels and the cluster definitions.
