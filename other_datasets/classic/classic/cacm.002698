Syntax-Directed Least-Errors Analysis for
Context-Free Languages: A Practical Approach
A least-errors recognizer is developed informally
using the well-known recognizer of Earley, 
along with elements of Bellman's dynamic programming.
 The analyzer takes a general class of context-free 
grammars as drivers, and any finite string as input.
 Recognition consists of a least-errors count for 
a corrected version of the input relative to the driver
grammar. The algorithm design emphasizes practical 
aspects which help in programming it.
