the analytical design of an axially symmetric laval
nozzle for a parallel and uniform jet .
  the equations for the nozzle's contours are derived by
integration of the characteristic equations of the axially symmetric flow .
since it is not possible to integrate these equations
mathematically in an exact form, it was necessary to find a way to
approximate the calculations .  the approximation offers itself by
considering and comparing the conditions of the flow in a cone with
those in a nozzle, as a linearization of the characteristic equations .
  the first part of the report deals with equations for the
transition curve by which the conical source flow is converted into a
parallel stream of uniform velocity .  the equations are derived
by integration along a mach line of the flow in the region where
the conversion takes place .  a factor f is introduced expressing a
relation between the direction and the velocity of the flow along
a certain mach line .  f remains undetermined and is not involved
in the final equations .
  in the second part of the report, the spherical sonic flow
section is converted into a plane circular section of the throat .
the nozzle's contour adjacent to the throat is formed by the arc
of a circle connected with the transition curve by a straight line .
the gas dynamic properties of the boundary mach line are
calculated in table 1, the use of which shortens the calculations
considerably .
