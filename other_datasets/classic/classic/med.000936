compensatory structural and functional changes in the kidney.
the radiographic assessment of the renal
size and the factors influencing renal
hypertrophy are discussed.  the importance
of compensatory hypertrophy and its
prognostic significance is emphasised.
the changes are correlated with renal function
as measured by the glomerular filtration
rate and renal plasma flow.
