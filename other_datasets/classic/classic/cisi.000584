The Practice of Charging Users for Information Services: A State of the Art
Report
   The state of the art literature review disclosed that society has not yet
come to the point that paying for library information services is a common 
thing.. It was also found that a sound basis for determining the costs of the
services - let alone charge for them - does not exist: While some data on 
specific cost for unit operations are available, it is very difficult to 
compare the data and arrive at meaningful figures.. Nevertheless, there is an
indication that large operating centers are becoming concerned with cost to the
point that they are cost-according their operations, which would permit them
to establish realistic fees for their services..
