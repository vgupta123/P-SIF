Index Term Weighting
   Various approaches to index term weighting have been investigated.. In
particular, claims have been made for the value of statistically-based
indexing in automatic retrieval systems.. The paper discusses the logic of 
different types of weighting, and describes experiments testing weighting 
schemes of these types.. The result show that one type of weighting leads to
material performance improvements in quite different collection environments..
