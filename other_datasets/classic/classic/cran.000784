heat transfer through the laminar boundary layer on
a circular cylinder in axial incompressible flow .
  this paper presents a method of calculating
the distribution of rate of heat transfer
into a laminar incompressible boundary layer
from the exterior surface of a long thin
circular cylinder, when the surface of the
cylinder is maintained at a constant
temperature and the flow is parallel to the
cylinder axis,. the temperature difference
between the surface and the main stream
is taken to be small enough to neglect
buoyancy effects .  a series solution, valid
for small downstream distances from the
nose, has been obtained already by seban,
bond, and kelly .  this is now extended
by deriving an asymptotic series solution,
valid at large downstream distances, and
bridging the gap between these two series
solutions by an approximate solution,
based on the method used recently by davies
and bourne to calculate heat transfer
from a flat plate .  the calculation is used to
demonstrate the effect of curvature
and of prandtl number on the local rate of heat
transfer at various downstream
distances by comparing with the corresponding flat plate results .
