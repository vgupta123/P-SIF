an improvement on donnell's approximation for thin-walled
circular cylinders .
  donnell's equation for thin-walled circular cylinders is replaced by
where w is a non-dimensional form of the radial displacement and q is
the distributed radial loading .  this equation retains the essential
simplicity of the original but, unlike donnell's equation, the accuracy
does not decrease as the wavelength of circumferential distortion
increases .
