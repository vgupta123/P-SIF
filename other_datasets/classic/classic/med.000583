hyperplastic lesions of mouse mammary
glands after treatment with 3-methyl-
cholanthrene
hyperplastic lesions were present in the mammary glands of
mice treated with 3-methylcholanthrene and exogenous hormones.  the
lesions were similar to those found in glands that were exposed to mammary
tumor virus.  it is probable that the production of mammary gland hyper-
plastic lesions could serve as a measure of the effectiveness of a chemical
compound as a carcinogenic agent for the mammary gland.
