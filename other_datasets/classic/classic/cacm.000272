A Storage Allocation Scheme for ALGOL 60
A storage allocation scheme for a machine
with a 2048 instruction core store and a magnetic 
drum is described.  The use of the drum for storing
program blocks and/or data must be directed by the 
programmer through auxiliary information in the ALGOL
program.  The administrative routines controlling 
the storage at run time are described in full.  A detailed example is given.
