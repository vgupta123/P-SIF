Information Retrieval
  The material of this book is aimed at advanced undergraduate
information (or computer) science students, postgraduate library
science students, and research workers in the field of IR.  Some of the
chapters, particularly Chapter 6, make simple use of a little advanced
mathematics.  However, the necessary mathematical tools can be easily
mastered from numerous mathematical texts that now exist and in any
case references have been given where the mathematics occur.
