heat transfer by laminar flow to a rotating plate .
heat transfer by laminar flow to a rotating plate .
  an exact solution of the heat-transfer problem for the von
karman example of the laminar flow of a viscous fluid over a
rotating plate is given in dimensionless form and physically
discussed .  the solution is explicitly given for a constant
temperature on the plate with viscous dissipation included .  the
numerical results are given for prandtl numbers from 0.5 to 10 .
