Densities of Use, and Absence of Obsolescence,
in Physics Journals at M I T
   Chen's data for the raw frequency of use of 138 physics journals in the
science library at M I T are re-examined and converted to densities of
use-per-meter of shelf.. Other units of size for obtaining densities,
and their measurement are discussed.. There is no evidence for synchronous
obsolescence in the 1955 to 1968 volumes of these journals: instead there is
some statistically significant evidence of greater density of use with
greater age.. Similar evidence elsewhere is cited.. The ranking order for
heaviness of use is also radically altered by converting raw frequencies
to densities of use.. 
   It is suggested that, for comparing the relative values of different
journals, or age groups, in library use or citation studies, analyses of
raw frequencies are valueless, and indeed potentially dangerously misleading, 
until they are converted to allow for the numbers of available items in each 
group examined..
