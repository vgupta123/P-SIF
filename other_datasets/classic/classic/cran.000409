on the base pressure resulting from the interaction of a supersonic
external stream with a sonic or subsonic jet .
it is shown that the two-dimensional base pressure problems relating to
base bleed into the wake of blunt-trailing-edge airfoils, or the
interaction between an external supersonic or sonic slipstream with a
sonic or subsonic jet stream of a jet engine, can be calculated by
theoretical considerations . constant-pressure, isoenergetic, turbulent
mixing between the streams and the stagnant fluid in the wake is
assumed . the theoretical calculations are in good agreement with the
experimental results .
