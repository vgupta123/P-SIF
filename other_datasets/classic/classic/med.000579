hypophysectomy and the lipolytic action of epinephrine in vitro
the response of normal adipose
tissue to epinephrine (0.05 ug/ml incubation
medium) is completely abolished by hypo-
physectomy of the donor rats.  treatment of
hypophysectomized rats with crude, whole
rat pituitary extract restored the lipolytic ac-
tion of epinephrine to normal.  posterior pi-
tuitary extract and corticotropin replacement
was without effect.  thyrotropin injections
produced a partial, and growth hormone
treatment a full restoration of the lipolytic
action of epinephrine.  treatment of hypo-
physectomized rats with cortisol or cortico-
sterone reestablished the sensitivity of their
adipose tissue to epinephrine, but only when
relatively large doses of these hormones were
given.  physiological doses of triiodothyronine
(1 ug/rat/day), however, restored the nor-
mal response to epinephrine.  it is concluded
that several endocrine factors can influence
the lipolytic action of epinephrine but that
their physiological importance cannot yet be
quantitated.
