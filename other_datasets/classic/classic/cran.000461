approximate methods fore predicting separation properties
of laminar boundary layers .
  some new solutions for steady incompressible laminar boundary
layer flow, obtained by gortler, have been used to test the accuracy of
two methods which are commonly used to predict separation .  a
modification of stratford's criterion for separation is given in this
paper and is probably the most accurate and the simplest of all methods
at present in use .  modified numerical functions are also given for
thwaites's method of predicting the main characteristics of the boundary
layer over the whole surface, which improve the accuracy of the method .
