theoretical pressure distribution on a hemisphere-cylinder
combination .
in recent years great use has been made of approximate methods for
the determination of the pressure distribution on blunt-nosed bodies
and afterbodies at high mach numbers .  for quasi-spherical bodies
it has been suggested that modified newtonian theory in combination
with a prandtl-meyer expansion be used on the nose portion, the two
laws being matched at the point where the pressure gradients are equal .
no simple approximation, however, has been found for flat-nosed bodies .
as for the pressure distribution on the afterbody, the blast-wave
analogy has been suggested for general nose shapes but particular
afterbody profiles .
the purpose of the present note is to compare these approximate
estimates with a more accurate determination of the flow field about
a hemisphere-cylinder in an ideal gas flow .  it was felt that since
experimental investigations in air at this mach number are scarce
and very difficult to obtain, the comparison would be of interest .  the
basis of comparison is the flow field as it results from a numerical
integration of the exact equations governing the motion of the ideal
fluid .
