absorption and excretion of toxogonin, an alkyl-phosphate antidote,
after intramuscular injection in man
tolerance, absorption and urinary excretion stu-
dies of toxogonin (bis-(4-hydroxyiminomethyl-
pyridine-1-methyl) ether dichloride), a specific anti-
dote in poisoning by esterase-blocking organic
phosphates, were made on 11 men by intramuscular
injection of 250 mg. (ca. 3 mg./kg.) of the drug,
given by self-injection ampoules.  injections made
with the automatic ampoule autule caused no local
irritation.  certain facial symptoms reported can for
the time being be regarded as resorptive side-effects
of toxogonin.  maximum blood levels of 6
ug./ml. were recorded within 20 minutes.  even after four
hours the level was still 1-2 ug./ml., a concentra-
tion amply sufficient to ensure reactivation of blood
esterases.  of the injected dose, 52% was excreted
in the urine after two hours, 87% after eight hours.
toxogonin appears to pass through the body un-
changed.
