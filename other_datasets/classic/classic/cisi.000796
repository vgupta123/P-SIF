Switching Languages for Indexing
   The paper describes some properties of simple interconversion devices which
enable material initially subject indexed by a particular indexing system to be
made available to other institutions using different indexing languages in such 
a form as to be readily integrated into their indexes.. Reference is made to the
outline Intermediate Lexicon which is the germinal form of a switching language
for the field of information science.. Difficulties and problems in effecting 
satisfactory information transfer through such an interconversion scheme are
explored, and suggestions made for the lines upon which further research needs
to be undertaken.. The author was the Classification Research Group 
representative on the international working party concerned with the 
Intermediate Lexicon..
