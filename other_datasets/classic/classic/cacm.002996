Transient-Free Working-Set Statistics
Transient-free average working set size and transient-free
missing-page rate for a finite sample 
of a reference string are defined.  Use of these statistics
is appropriate if the contents of the working 
set at the start of the recorded string are unknown.
 If a certain stationarity condition holds, these 
statistics provide unbiased estimates of expected working-set
sizes, missing-page probabilities, and 
in terreference distance probabilities.  Two other pairs
of estimators are shown to be biased.  Expressions 
for the transient-free statistics are obtained in terms
of in terval statistics. Several methods of computation 
are discussed, the usefulness of each depending on length
of the sample, number of distinct references, 
and the amount of main storage available to the computer
performing the calculations.  In particular, 
methods are described for handling long strings
containing many distinct page names.
