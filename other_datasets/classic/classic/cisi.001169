The Emerging Science of Information
   Discussing whether it is possible and sensible to build up a general science
of information, the author comes to the conclusion that all the necessary 
prerequisites to formation of this new discipline, to be termed "informology",
are ripe.. The structure of informology and its interrelationships with
informatics are investigated.. A diagram showing the place occupied by
informology within the overall framework of sciences and its inner structure is
presented..
