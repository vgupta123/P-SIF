Text Searching Retrieval of Answer-Sentences and Other Answer-Passages
   Some new text searching retrieval techniques are described which retrieve
not documents but sentences from documents and sometimes (on occasions
determined by the computer) multi-sentence sequences.. Since the goal of the
techniques is retrieval of answer-providing documents, "answer-passages" are
retrieved.. An "answer-passage" is a passage which is either answer-providing
or "answer-indicative," i.e., it permits inferring that the document 
containing it is answer-providing.. In most cases answer-sentences, i.e., 
single-sentence answer-passages, are retrieved.. This has great advantages
for screening retrieval output..
   Two new automatic procedures for measuring closeness of relation
between clue words in a sentence are described.. One approximates
syntactic closeness by counting the number of intervening "syntactic
joints" (roughly speaking, prepositions, conjunctions and punctuation
marks) between successive clue words.. The other measure uses word
proximity in a new way.. The two measures perform about equally well..
   The computer uses "enclosure" and "connector words" for determining
when a multi-sentence passage should be retrieved.. However, no procedure
was found in this study for retrieving multi-paragraph answer-passages, 
which were the only answer-passages occurring in 6% of the papers..
   In a test of the techniques they failed to retrieve two 
answer-providing documents (7% of those to be retrieved) because of
one multi-paragraph answer-passage and one complete failure
of clue word selection.. For the other answer-providing documents they
retrieved at all recall levels with greater precision than SMART, 
which has produced the best previously reported recall-precision results..
   The retrieval questions (mostly from real users) and documents used in
this study were from the field of information science.. The results of the
study are surprisingly good for retrieval in such a "soft science," and
it is reasonable to hope that in less "soft" sciences and technologies
the techniques described will work even better.. On this basis a 
dissemination and retrieval system of the near future is predicted..
