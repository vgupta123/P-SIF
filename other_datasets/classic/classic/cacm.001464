An ALGOL Compiler: Construction and Use
in Relation to an Elaborate Operating System
An ALGOL translator has been prepared and integrated
into the IBSYS Operating System.  Assembly 
and "go" features of IBSYS permit immediate execution with
optional listings, decks and debugging information. 
 Using the chain feature of IBSYS, links written in
MAP or FORTRAN as well as ALGOL may be called by 
the ALGOL main program.  In addition, procedures coded
in MAP may be included in any ALGOL program.  
Although assembly plus loading time exceeds compilation
time, the total time is satisfactory and the 
user gets ease and facility which are fully compensating.
