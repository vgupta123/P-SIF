More on Extensible Machines
One of the most salient characteristics of extensible
machines (EM) is the facility for providing 
system control over program-to-program and program-to-data
linkage (e.g., address connection).  It is 
the intent of this paper to expand and clarify the remarks
concerning program-to-program and program-to-data 
linkage that were embodied in the authors' previous
paper on the EM concepts, and to, finally, trace 
the employment of linkage mechanisms through
various levels of programming languages.
