the divergence of supersonic wings including chordwise
bending .
  the static aeroelastic stability or divergence problem is
investigated for thin supersonic wings when not only the spanwise
bending and twist are taken into account but also the chordwise
bending .  the problem is treated in successive phases of
increasing complexity from the two-dimensional curling-up of the
leading edge to the three-dimensional stability of the cantilever
wing .  several methods of approach are developed including
the nonlinear aspects of the structure and the aerodynamics .
results indicate a strong dependence of stability on poisson's
ratio and the magnitude of the deformation .
