Information Storage and Retrieval:
tools, elements, theories
  This textbook grew out of some discussions between the authors
about the interdisciplinary character of the field of information storage
and retrieval.  We both felt that the need existed to show what
each professional group concerned with the solution of information
storage and retrieval problems could contribute.  A university-level
course was developed, based on the concept that each person should
be made aware of how others could help him.  The course was presented
about a dozen times over the ensuing years, and this book is based on it.
