An Analytic Model of the Hasp Execution Task Monitor
The HASP Execution Task Monitor periodically
rearranges the OS/360 dispatching chain to give 
tasks preemptive execution priority in inverse order to
that of their cpu utilization history.  The effect 
is to keep the I/O bound tasks active and to prevent
cpu bound tasks from locking out other tasks.  This 
paper develops a simple model of the Execution Task
Monitor and employs it to study the effectiveness 
of the monitor in improving system performance.  A
modified strategy monitor control is investigated 
for the case of task execution in a memory hierarchy of varying speeds.
