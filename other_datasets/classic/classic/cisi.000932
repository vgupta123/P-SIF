The Urban Library Dilemma
  The American urban public library is in something of a dilemma. Relatively 
secure in the affections of the populace, the library is nevertheless
frequently threatened by loss of income. The threats are cyclical and are
associated with the local tax picture, which at the present time is notably
obscure.  The abortive attempts earlier this year to reduce appropriations for
the libraries in Newark and New York received widespread attention both because
the libraries are quite visible nationally and because the proposed cuts were
preposterously unmistakable.  In the eye of the politician who must find that 
tiny bit of safe water between the shoals of economy and those of service, the 
library appears to be expendable ballast to be dumped in heavy weather.  In 12
years in two city libraries, I have seen almost every budget year produce a
critical fight to prevent disaster from overtaking the library.  I think the
experience is not uncommon.  Only the most extraordinary efforts keep most 
urban libraries from going under. Libraries seldom thrive; they survive.
Periods of calm and prosperity are rare for urban public libraries in the 
richest nation in the world during this era of extraordinary national economic 
success. The paradox invites some critical self-analysis.
