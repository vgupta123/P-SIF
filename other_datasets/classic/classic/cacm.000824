DESCRIPTRAN-Automated Descriptive Geometry*
Descriptive geometry consists of procedures originally
designed to solve 3-space geometry problems 
by graphical constructions and measurement instead of
by computation.  However, in addition to this it 
unifies and simplifies the approach to many such problems.
 When one can call subroutines that compute 
new coordinates that correspond to those obtainable from
the graphical constructions, there is the three-way 
advantage of the approach of descriptive geometry, the
accuracy of computation and the speed of the digital 
computer.  DESCRIPTRAN makes it possible to program
many problems in 3-space with a few statements; it 
consists of 15 subroutines analogous to the procedures of descriptive geometry.
