Relevance Assessments and Retrieval System Evaluation
   Two widely used criteria for evaluating the effectiveness of information 
retrieval system are, respectively, the recall and the precision.. Since the 
determination of these measures is dependent on a distinction between documents 
which are relevant to a given query and documents which are not relevant to that
query, it has sometimes been claimed that an accurate, generally valid 
evaluation cannot be based on recall and precision measures..
   A study was made to determine that effect of variations in relevance 
assessments on the average recall and precision values used to measure 
retrieval effectiveness.. Using a collection of 1200 documents in information 
science for test purposes, it is found that large scale differences in the 
relevance assessments do not produce significant variations in average recall 
and precision.. It thus appears that properly computed recall and precision 
data may represent effectiveness indicators which are generally valid for many 
distinct user classes..
