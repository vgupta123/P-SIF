the flow about a moving body in the upper ionosphere .
  a particle approach is used to study the flow pattern around a
body moving in the upper layers of the ionosphere .  the effects
of distant encounters between charged particles (dynamic
friction) and of the earth's magnetic field are taken into account .
it is shown that, when the magnetic lines of force are parallel
to the direction of motion of the body, there may be a marked
concentration of charged particles in the vicinity of the body
and a considerable fraction of the reflected or deflected charged
particles may reimpinge on the body surface .  a numerical
example is given for the size and shape of the charged-
particle-density contours in the flow field surrounding a circular disc,
and these are compared with the corresponding neutral-particle
contours .
