hemihypertrophy and medullary sponge kidney
congenital hemihypertrophy is an over-
growth of one side of the body which is
associated with an asymmetry beyond the ex-
pected range.  it is to be distinguished from
hemiatrophy in which atrophy or withering of
one half of the body has occurred, usually be-
cause of neurological lesions.
this condition of hemihypertrophy, though
rare, is very frequently associated with other
congenital abnormalities.  these include several
in the urogenital tract, such as hypospadias,
cryptorchidism, unilateral renal hypertrophy
and an increased incidence of wilms' tumour.
