Choosing Physiology Journals
  For many years administrators of library collections have sought
objective criteria for assembling well-rounded periodical collections
in the subject fields represented by their collections.  The nearest
approach to any criterion which does away with the a priori knowledge
of the specialist was first suggested by Gross and Gross in 1927.  This
method consists, essentially, of counting the bibliographic citations at
the conclusions of the articles in a basic periodical of the field under
consideration, and of arranging the journals cited in order of the
frequency of their citation.  Thus, in the field of chemistry, the 
references in the Journal of the American Chemical Society are counted and
a list is made of the most frequently cited journals.  According to Gross
and Gross, the journals which are cited most frequently in the Journal of the
American Chemical Society are the most valuable journals for a library
to purchase in order to possess a well-rounded collection in chemistry.
  Although the Gross and Gross method has been in use for almost twenty
years, the fundamental assumptions upon which the method is based have
never been examined.  These assumptions are:
1. The value of a periodical to a professional worker is in direct
   proportion to the number of times it is cited in the professional
   literature.
2. The journal or journals used as the base for the tabulation are
   representative of the entire field.
3. If more than one journal is used as a base, all of them can be weighted
   equally.
