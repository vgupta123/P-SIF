non-equilibrium flow of an ideal dissociating gas .
non-equilibrium flow of an ideal dissociating gas .
the theory of an'ideal dissociating'gas developed by lighthill/1957/for
conditions of thermodynamic equilibrium is extended to non-equilibrium
conditions by postulating a simple rate equation for the dissociation
process/including the effects of recombination/ . this equation contains
 the'equilibrium'parameters of the lighthill theory plus a further
dissociation phenomena .
the behaviour of this gas is investigated in flow through a strong
normal shock wave and past a bluff body . the assumption is made that
the gas receives complete excitation of its rotational and vibrational
degrees of freedom in an infinitesimally thin region according to the
familiar rankine-hugoniot shock wave relations before dissociation
begins . the variation of the relevant thermodynamic variables
down-stream of this region is then computed in a few particular cases . the
method used in the latter case is an extension of the'newtonian'theory
of hypersonic inviscid flow . in particular, the case of a sphere is
treated in some detail . the variation of the shock shape and the
sphere diameter to the length scale of the dissociation process, is
exhibited for conditions extending from completely undissociated flow
to dissociated flow in thermal equilibrium . results would indicate
that significant and observable changes from the undissociated values
occur, although values for the non-equilibrium parameter are not, at
present, available .
