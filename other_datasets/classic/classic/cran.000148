on displacement thickness .
  four alternative theoretical treatments of 'displacement
thickness', and, generally, of the influence of boundary layers
and wakes on the flow outside them, are set out, first for
two-dimensional, and then for three-dimensional, laminar or turbulent,
incompressible flow .  they may be called the methods of 'flow
reduction', 'equivalent sources', 'velocity comparison' and
  the principal expression obtained for the displacement
thickness in three-dimensional flow may be written
if, as orthogonal coordinates (x,y) specifying position on the
surface, we choose x as the velocity potential of the external
flow, and y as a coordinate, constant along the external-flow
streamlines, such that h dy is the distance between (x,y) and
z is the distance from the surface, u and v are the x and y components
of velocity, and u takes the value u just outside the boundary layer .
