the aerodynamic effects of aspect ratio and sweepback
on wing flutter .
  the report describes tests to obtain direct
measurements of the aerodynamic effects of aspect ratio and
sweepback on wing flutter .  the tests were made on rigid
wings with root flexibilities .
  it is shown that measured effects of aspect ratio and
sweepback on the flutter of these wings can be represented
quite closely in flutter calculations based on two-dimensional
flow theory by multiplying the two-dimensional
aerodynamic coefficients by appropriate factors .  the effect of
sweepback is represented by multiplying all aerodynamic
coefficients by cos, where is the wing leading-edge
sweepback, and the effect of aspect ratio is represented by
multiplying the aerodynamic damping coefficients by 1f(a) and,
the stiffness coefficients by 1(f(a)) where a is the
aspect ratio .
  for the wings tested an average value for
f(a) is f(a) = (1 + (0.8a)) .
