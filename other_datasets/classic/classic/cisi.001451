Some Behavioral Patterns of Library Users:  The 80/20 rule
  A characteristic of inventory in business or industry
is that approximately 80 percent of the number of
transactions taken from a warehouse represents about
20 percent of the items stocked.  This may also be
considered as a ranking of stock items by their
transaction activity which will show that the top 20
percent of the stocked items (i.e., the most active
items) account for about 80 percent of the total
number of transactions.  The rule is sometimes
expressed as the 75/25 rule with the same interpretation.
It is only by coincidence that the figures add to 100
as the phenomena relate to the relationships between
the two statistical measures.
