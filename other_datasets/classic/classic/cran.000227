theory on the drag of straight edge wings .
  the curve of drag against mach number for straight-edged wings,
calculated by using the linearised theory of supersonic flow, displays
discontinuities in slope at the various mach numbers for which the edges
are sonic .  these features, which are not observed in practice, are due
to the fact that linearised theory predicts an infinite pressure along
a subsonic or sonic edge .  it is shown that if the linearised equation
of supersonic flow is used to determine the flow over straight-edged
wings, but the linearised boundary condition is replaced by the full
placed by plausible values .  on this basis a simple method is derived
for improving the linearised predictions of the drag of straight-edged
wings which exhibits satisfactory agreement with experimental results .
  while the technique is not directly applicable to ridge lines, an
artifice renders them amenable to similar treatment .
