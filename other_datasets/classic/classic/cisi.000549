The Intergroup Conflict
    In one broad category of theories, the problems are expressed
in terms of actualities of events in group relations as they
exist in everyday life.  On the whole, theories advanced by
many social scientists fall in this broad category.  In this
concern over actualities the problem is frequently not stated and
discussion not developed in a way that can be tested rigorously.
In the second broad category of theories, problems are stated
and analysis carried out in terms of more rigorous-appearing
concepts and units of analysis.  Theories coming from psychologists
and social scientists heavily influenced by them fall within
this broad category.  In this line of approach, theories are
advanced without due regard to actualities, and consequently
they are plagued with serious questions of validity.
