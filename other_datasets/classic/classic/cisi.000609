Report on the Evaluation of an Experimental Computer-Based 
Current-Awareness Service for Chemists
   A selected sample of U.K. University, industrial and Government scientists
were given a current-awareness service for 18 months, in order to investigate
the practicability and problems of such a service.. Six hundred profiles were 
run, using the natural-language data bases Chemical Titles and 
Chemical-Biological Activities produced by Chemical Abstracts Service..
   Precision and recall were measured, and correlations between profile
performance and such factors as subject area and profile logic were 
investigated statistically.. Precision and recall failures were analyzed and 
various improvements to the system were suggested as a consequence..
   It was concluded that a viable computerized current-awareness service based 
on searching natural language could be created..
