  this paper presents the results of an investigation conducted in
the langley 16-foot transonic tunnel to determine the effects of varying
reynolds number on the pressure distribution on a transonic body of
revolution at angles of attack through the transonic speed range .  the
effect of a change in sting cone angle on the pressure distributions
and a comparison of experimental incremental pressures with theory is
also included .
  the models were tested through a mach number range from 0.60 to 1.09 .
the reynolds number range based on body length was from 9 x 10 to 39 x
diameter was 1.3 x 10 to 4.53 x 10 for the model at 8 angle of attack .
  an increase in reynolds number from 9 x 10 to 39 x 10 affected
the longitudinal pressure distributions very slightly .  these effects
were of such a nature as to cause an increase of 0.05 in the
normal-force coefficient of the body when tested in the subcritical cross-flow
reynolds number range .  this increase is in agreement with theoretical
approximations .
  a comparison between experimental and theoretical values of the
incremental pressure coefficient due to angle of attack indicated good
agreement except at angles where separated flow areas existed over the
body .
  the effect of a change in sting-cone angle from 5 to 9 on the
pressure distribution of the 120-inch model was negligible up to a
mach number of 1.05 .  at this mach number the effect was to cause a
small increase in the velocity over the rear of the body .
