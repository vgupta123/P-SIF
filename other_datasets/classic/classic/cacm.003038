Using Encryption for Authentication in Large Networks of Computers
Use of encryption to achieve authenticated
communication in computer networks is discussed. 
 Example protocols are presented for the establishment
of authenticated connections, for the management 
of authenticated mail, and for signature verification
and document integrity guarantee.  Both conventional 
and public-key encryption algorithms are considered as the basis for protocols.
