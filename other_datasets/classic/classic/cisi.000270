Conflict in Libraries
   Intergroup conflict in libraries is explored, including conflict between
departments, between professionals and bureaucracy, and between older and newer
staff members.. Other special interests such as informal power-holders and the
subprofessional are identified.. This analysis shows that existing 
organizational relationships in libraries let "means" become "ends".. Strong
forces toward conformity hamper desirable growth and change.. A restructuring
of libraries is proposed along the lines of professional rather than 
semiprofessional organizations.. Principal changes to be made are in existing
processing-service relationships and administrative-professional 
relationships..
