The Development of Precis:  
A Theoretical and Technical History
  Before starting to trace the development of PRECIS to its
theoretical beginnings I shall describe the system briefly in its present
form.  This will serve not only as an introduction for those who are not
familiar with the system, but will also help to explain the relevance of
some of the historical sections which follow, in which we shall see how a
machine-produced alphabetical indexing system, based on a syntax derived
from a study of natural language, developed out of research into 
principles for a new general classification.
  PRECIS, or the PREserved Context Indexing System, differs in some
respects from traditional alphabetical indexes and lists of subject headings.
Like the system developed by Coates for the British Technology Index,
PRECIS consists essentially of a set of working procedures, not a prescribed
list of terms or phrases.  The system is firmly based upon the concept of an
open-ended vocabulary, which means that terms can be admitted into the
index at any time, as soon as they have been encountered in literature.
Once a term has been admitted, its relationships with other terms are
handled in two different ways, distinguished as the syntactical and the
semantic sides of the system.
