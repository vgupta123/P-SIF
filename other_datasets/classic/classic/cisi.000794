'Half-Life'
  The first diagram below gives a schematic view of a subject literature that
is growing exponentially with time - the number of items published per
year doubles in five years.  Each square of the paper represents a published
item.
  The marks on the diagram represent current uses of the literature (say,
citations made or items borrowed this year).  The inked squares are actual
uses.  The dots are hypothetical uses - those that would occur if every 
published item had an equal chance of being used (in fact, every fifth item is
dotted).
