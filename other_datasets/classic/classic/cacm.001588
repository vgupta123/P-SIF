PL/I List Processing
The concepts of list processing have been introduced
into the PL/I language.  With these new 
facilities, it is possible to write PL/I procedures that
operate on simple and complex data list organizations. 
 Most list-processing languages have suffered from their
inability to deal directly with complex data 
structures and/or from their inability to perform the
complete range of programming language operations 
upon the data list structures.  These two problems have
been eliminated in the list-processing facilities 
of PL/I.  The basic concepts of list processing and
the philosophy of the PL/I language extensions are 
discussed.  In addition, several detailed list-processing examples are provided.
