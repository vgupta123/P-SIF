What Makes An Automatic Keyword Classification Effective?
   Though the idea of constructing a keyword classification for retrieval
purposes automatically is not a new one, comparatively few systematic
experiments have been carried out in this area; and while many suggestions
have been put forward, not enough is known about the behaviour of automatic
keyword classifications, and hence about the properties such classifications
should have and the ways they should be used.. In previous experiments we
showed that some forms of classification could give good results, and this
paper describes a further series of tests designed to examine this sort of
classification in more detail, with a view to establishing the optimum forms
of classification and procedures for using them in different retrieval 
situations.. These tests demonstrate that further improvements in 
performance over that for unclassified keywords can be obtained, and that
definite conclusions can be drawn about the correct approach to classification
for collections like the test one: the best results are given when grouping
is confined to strongly connected, nonfrequent keywords, when the 
classification is used to provide additional rather than alternative indexing
terms, particularly for requests, and when matching is controlled by keyword
frequency..
