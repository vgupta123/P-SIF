Managing An Uncontrolled Vocabulary Ex Post Facto
   Initiated as an experiment, supported by the Division of Medicinal
Chemistry of Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, the operational
retrospective retrieval service offered by BIOSIS, now in its eighth year, 
exploits a file created essentially without vocabulary control.. The file
comprises some 40 million index access points to 1.87 million references
in research biology announced in Biological Abstracts and BioResearch
Index since September 1959.. A pragmatic program of file building criteria
has been pursued, originally with modest support from the Office of Science
Information Service of the National Science Foundation, which has provided
improved retrieval and an annual summary of the vocabulary of the literature
available to anyone interested (1)..
