Interactive Bibliographic Search:
The User/Computer Interface
    On the 14th and 15th of January, 1971, a Workshop on "The User
Interface for Interactive Search of Bibliographic Data Bases" was held at
Ricky's Hyatt House in Palo Alto, California.  The Workshop, sponsored by
the Information Systems committee of the American Federation of
Information Processing Societies, brought together a group of information
scientists who have been directly involved with this subject area.  They were
provided in advance with a "Challenge" paper and with a number of papers
prepared in response to that challenge.  The Workshop sessions themselves
were devoted exclusively to focussed discussions of the material and of the
problems in and the prospects for more effective systems design of the user
interface.  The content of these two days of deliberation prompted making
the substance of the Workshop experience available to a larger audience.
This book is intended to accomplish that goal.
