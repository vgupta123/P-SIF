A Fast Storage Allocator
A fast storage bookkeeping method is described
which is particularly appropriate for list-structure 
operations and other situations involving many sizes
of blocks that are fixed in size and location.  
 This scheme, used in the LLLLLL or L6 (Bell Telephone Laboratories
Low-Level List Language), makes available 
blocks of computer registers in several different sizes:
the smaller blocks are obtained by successively 
splitting larger ones in half, and the larger blocks are reconstituted
if and when their parts are simultaneously 
free.
