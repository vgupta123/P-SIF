experimental study of the velocity and temperature
distribution in a high-velocity vortex-type flow .
  the vortex tube represents a simple device in which a
particular type of vortex motion may be studied in the
laboratory in an attempt to obtain a better understanding
of such flows .  such an investigation has been pursued in
the heat transfer laboratory of the university of
minnesota .  the present paper summarizes the major results of
this vortex-tube investigation .
