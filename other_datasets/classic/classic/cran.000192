on the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodies
of revolution .
  a similar solution of the hypersonic viscous flow past slender bodies
of revolution is deduced for a special case when the radial coordinate
of the body surface at section x is proportional to x, where the radial
coordinate have the comparable order value with the thickness of the
boundary layer .  here, /similar/ is used in the direct meaning that
distributions in the boundary layer keep the similar form lengthwise .
calculations are accomplished for the region of strong interaction
between the boundary layer and the shock wave .  from several calculations
it may be expected that if the thickness of the body becomes small, the
thickness of the layer in which the longitudinal velocity component u is
rapidly decreased also becomes small, and in the major part of the
boundary layer, only the normal component v is increased .  further if
the thickness of the body is increased, then, the height of the shock
wave, the pressure on the wall, and the shear stress at the wall are
also increased while the boundary layer thickness is decreased .  the
nose region is excluded by the reason that the ordinary boundary layer
theory will be invalid there .
