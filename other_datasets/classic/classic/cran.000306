second approximation to laminar compressible boundary
layer on flat plate in slip flow .
  the first-order solution for the laminar compressible boundary-layer
flow over a flat plate at constant wall temperature is given .  the
effect of slip at the wall as well as the interaction between the
boundary-layer flow and the outer stream flow are taken into
consideration .  the solution is obtained explicitly in terms of the known zero
order, or continuum, solution .  no
assumptions regarding the prandtl
number or viscosity-temperature law need be made .  it is found that the
first-order solution gives a decrease in heat transfer and, for
supersonic flow, an increase in skin friction .
for subsonic flow there is no
first-order shear effect .  the change in heat transfer is due to slip
and the change in friction is due to the interaction of the zero- and
first-order velocities at the outer edge of the boundary layer .
