   GRAD Assistant - A Program for Symbolic Algebraic Manipulation and 
Differentiation
   The General Recursive Algebra and Differentiation Assistant (GRAD Assistant)
now under development is a set of LISP functions which symbolically manipulate
abd differentiate algebraic expressions. It is designed for use with problemms 
in which a large amount of routine manipulation is to be done by a program 
without human intervention. Thus, GRAD must recognize necessary simplifications
without external guidance. While some complicated expressions (notably ones
involving nested radicals and trigonometric functions) do not yield completely
to the present version, it has proved quite useful indeed.
