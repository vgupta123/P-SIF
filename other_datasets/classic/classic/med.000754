trisomy 17-18 syndrome with congenital
extrahepatic biliary atresia and congenital
amputation of the left foot
the phenotypic characteristics of
the 17-18 trisomy syndrome have been well
described.  among the most recently docu-
mented cases of this syndrome are those
with findings of agenesis or aplasia of various
bones of the forearm and hand, in addition
to the more classical symptoms.
we have recently studied a case of trisomy
17-18 syndrome with congenital absence of
the left foot, and congenital extrahepatic
biliary atresia.
