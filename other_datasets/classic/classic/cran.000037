a new technique for investigating heat transfer and
surface phenomena under hypersonic flow conditions .
on the forebody of many practically interesting hypersonic
vehicles, there is little interaction between the inviscid
flow field and the boundary layer .  therefore, inviscid flow theory
can be used to determine, independent of surface phenomena,
the physically interesting quantities such as shock shape, shock
detachment distance, sonic line shape, and pressure distribution .
furthermore, the pressure distribution so determined can then be
used for the study of heat transfer, materials behavior, and other
surface phenomena .  thus, for these bodies, the prandtl
boundary-layer concept can be utilized for the calculation of both the
inviscid flow and the boundary-layer behavior .
  it is the purpose of this note to point out that this concept can
also be applied experimentally in order to provide, in
conjunction with a conventional hypersonic wind-tunnel air supply, a
means for investigating hypersonic heat transfer and surface
phenomena under conditions of flight reynolds numbers .
