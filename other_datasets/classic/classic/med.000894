the causes of delayed development of speech.
speech develops parallelly and simultaneously
with psychophysical development of
the child, arising from internal need and
under the influence of external factors.  not
all children are given the chance to develop
in favorable conditions and to pass through
all the phases of development without some
injury.  the various possibilities when a
child may be injured and hampered in the
development of speech are discussed.  the
testing of the sense of hearing in children
with a cleft palate is also included-out of
181 cases of cleft palate, in 72 cases there
was decrease of the sense of hearing exceeding
30 db.  this additional injury of
the child with a cleft palate, if remaining unnoticed,
may make the treatment of speech
abnormality difficult.  the necessity of
diagnostic team investigation and the treatment
of children with speech disturbances
are emphasized.
