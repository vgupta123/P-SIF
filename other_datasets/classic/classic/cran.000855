simplified formulas for boundary value problems of
the thin-- walled circular cylinder .
  n. j. hoff has presented formulas which can be used in
the solution of boundary-value problems of circular
cylinders .  the purpose of this note is to express these
results in exact simplified form,. a more detailed
investigation appears elsewhere .  the notation will be that of
hoff unless otherwise stated .
