second order theory for unsteady supersonic flow
past slender pointed bodies of revolution .
  the thermodynamic properties (z = pv rt, e rt, h rt, s r,
and pressure) are given for equilibrium mixtures of dissociated and
ionized molecules and atoms of the elements nitrogen and oxygen
having the low temperature composition of .78847 n and .21153 o .
the tabulated properties of this mixture (a close approximation to
the properties of air) are given at close intervals from 2000 to
and 10 times the normal density .  the results are based on
chemical equilibria between the species o, o, n, n, no, no, no,
no, o, o, o, o, n, n, n and electrons .  the method of
presentation permits later corrections for the effect of argon and co
and the contribution of intermolecular forces .  the calculations are
based on 9.758 e.v. as the dissociation energy of molecular nitrogen
and 1.45 e.v. as the electron affinity of atomic oxygen .
