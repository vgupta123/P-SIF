On the Computation of Least Squares Polynomials
Rounding error accumulated during digital computation
of a least squares polynomial makes the 
computed polynomial only an approximation to the true least
square polynomial.  A simple method for adjust ing 
the constant term of the computed polynomial to get
a better approximation to the true least squares 
polynomial is described.
