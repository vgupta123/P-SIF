calculated spanwise lift distributions, influence functions
and influence coefficients for unswept wings in subsonic
flow .
  spanwise lift distributions have been calculated for nineteen
unswept wings with various aspect ratios and taper ratios and
with a variety of angle-of-attack or twist distributions, including
flap and aileron deflections, by means of the weissinger method
with eight control points on the semispan .  also calculated
were aerodynamic influence coefficients which pertain to a
certain definite set of stations along the span, and several
methods are presented for calculating aerodynamic influence
functions and coefficients for stations other than those stipulated .
  the information presented herein can be used in the analysis
of untwisted wings or wings with known twist distributions, as
well as in aeroelastic calculations involving initially unknown
twist distributions .
