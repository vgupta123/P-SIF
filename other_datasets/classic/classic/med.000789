palliative radiation therapy
the care of the patient with "incurable" cancer may be
directed by physicians of various backgrounds and per-
suasions.  if this physician has little experience in such
care, he is prone to be influenced by still prevalent atti-
tudes of therapeutic futility or by equally unjustified
premature claims for widely publicized methods recent on
the scene.  surgery and radiation therapy remain the
dominant treatment forces for the patient with cancer.  it
is unfortunate that lack of demonstration of good radiation
therapy has led to unjustified condemnation of the method
rather than the user, with resultant loss to the patient's
welfare.  to obtain maximal benefit, radiation therapy
must be allowed indications and contraindications like any
therapeutic modality.  these must be the responsibility of
the therapeutic radiologist.  application of realistically
stringent indications and contraindications does not lessen
useful accomplishment, but avoids unnecessary morbidity,
waste of time, money and effort, and delay in seeking
suitable treatment.
