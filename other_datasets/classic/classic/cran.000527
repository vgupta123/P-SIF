note on the three-point boundary layer problem for
the blasius equations .
in a recent paper a method was presented for obtaining
higher accuracy in the numerical solution of the blasius
equation with three-point boundary conditions .  the
well-known blasius equation was previously developed in an
investigation of the steady two-dimensional incompressible
boundary-layer flow over a flat plate, but it has been extensively used in
investigating other fluid flow problems .  the three-point
boundary-value problem is encountered in the theory of laminar
mixing and in approximate analyses of separated and wake
flows as noted in ref. 1 .
