an aerodynamic analysis for flutter in oseen-type viscous
flow .
  oseen's equations for unsteady flow are employed to obtain
a linearized solution based on a discontinuous-wake model .
the analysis is employed to estimate the viscous correction to
unsteady lift and moment at large reynolds number .  if the
asymptotic solution is not too slowly convergent, the correction
is of the order of the ratio of the logarithm of reynolds number
to the reynolds number .  the theory is preliminary in nature
as it is limited by the accuracy of oseen's equations and is
restricted to small angle of attack .  however, it also shows that
the generalized trailing-edge condition for potential flow is
reasonable and might predict the essential correction in a real
fluid .
