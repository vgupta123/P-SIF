laminar mixing of a non-uniform stream with a fluid
at rest .
  a theoretical analysis is made of the constant pressure
laminar mixing process between a stream having an initial boundary layer
velocity profile, and a fluid at rest .
  the present theory follows the methods of w. tollmien and
s. i. pai with certain modifications .
the results apply to incompressible
flow, but can be extended to the compressible case without difficulty .
