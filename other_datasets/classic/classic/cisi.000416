Human Behavior and the Principles of Least Effort 
An Introduction to Human Ecology
  Nearly twenty-five years ago it occurred to me that we might gain 
considerable insight into the mainsprings of human behavior if we viewed it
purely as a natural phenomenon like everything else in the universe, and if
we studied it with the same dispassionate objectivity with which one is wont
to study, say, the social behavior of bees, or the nestbuilding habits of
birds.  The present book reports the results of the extended inquiry that
ensued in the course of those years, and which led to the disclosure of
some fundamental principles that seem to govern important aspects of our
behavior, both as individuals and as members of social groups.
