HDB of Data Processing for Libraries
  The four years since the first edition of this book was published have been a
period of exceptional advance in the usage of computers in libraries.  Where
one or two examples were all that were available at that time to illustrate
each kind of application, now there are five to ten; where the cadre of
knowledgeable people in libraries at that time was small, now virtually
every major library has some kind of systems department; where the efforts at
that time were largely experimental and developmental, now there is a wealth.
This second edition has therefore been written in a context totally different
from that of the first.
  But its aims are the same; to ensure that practicing librarians and that
students in library schools approach the world of automation with knowledge
of its capabilities and limitations and with the techniques of systems
analysis by which to analyze and evaluate alternative answers to the library's
processing problems.  The changes from the first edition therefore represent
not a departure from that purpose but simply an updating of its content, to
reflect the advances and experience gained, and an opportunity to correct
the errors (hopefully minor) that have been found through use of the first
edition.
