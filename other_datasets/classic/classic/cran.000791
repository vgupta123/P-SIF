'ogee' wings .
  measurements have been made of
the longitudinal characteristics of one
plane and three cambered slender ogee
wings (p = 0.45,) at two
subsonic and eight supersonic mach
numbers up to 2.8 .  the tests also included
measurements of the zero-lift pressure
drag and support interference of the
plane wing .  the results have been analysed
to give data for estimating the
performance of supersonic transport aircraft .
