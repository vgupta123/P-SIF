analysis of stresses in the elements of shell structure .
the love-meissner analysis for thin shells has previously been applied
to cones of uniform wall thickness, and solutions for the stress
resultants were given in terms of kelvin's functions . since
tabulation of these functions for large arguments is not practical,
considerable computation was still required .  in the present paper, the authors
define special functions which eliminate the necessity of evaluating
kelvin/s functions and which may be used with simple algebraic and
trigonometric functions to compute the boundary forces and displacements
for cones for various loading conditions .  these special functions also
make clear the magnitude of errors which result from geckeler/s and
other approximate solutions .
