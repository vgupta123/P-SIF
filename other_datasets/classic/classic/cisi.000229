A Mathematical Theory of Communication
  In this final installment of the paper we consider the case where the
signals or the messages or both are continuously variable, in contrast with
the discrete nature assumed until now.  To a considerable extent the
continuous case can be obtained through a limiting process from the discrete
case by dividing the continuum of messages and signals into a large but finite
number of small regions and calculating the various parameters involved on
a discrete basis.  As the size of the regions is decreased these parameters in
general approach as limits the proper values for the continuous case.  There
are, however, a few new effects that appear and also a general change of
emphasis in the direction of specialization of the general results to
particular cases.
  We will not attempt, in the continuous case, to obtain our results with
the greatest generality, or with the extreme rigor of pure mathematics, since
this would involve a great deal of abstract measure theory and would
obscure the main thread of the analysis.  A preliminary study, however,
indicates that the theory can be formulated in a completely axiomatic and
rigorous manner which includes both the continuous and discrete cases and
many others. The occasional liberties taken with limiting processes in the
present analysis can be justified in all cases of practical interest.
