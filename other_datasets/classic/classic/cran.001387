  reasons for investigation.--for an efficient design
of spar with thin sheet web it is important to know
the load which will just cause the web to buckle .  as stiffeners
divide the web into panels, it is required to find the
buckling stress of rectangular panels bounded on two sides by
spar flanges and on the other two sides by stiffeners .
boundary conditions which represent closely this type of edge
fixing are clamping (along the flanges) and simple support
critical shear stress for a square panel held in this way .
  conclusions and further development.--it is found that the
value of the critical shear stress is almost midway between
its values when all four edges are clamped and all four edges
are simply supported .
  the method of solution developed in this report is of very
general application, and can be used to investigate the
stability of rectangular panels when the loading is any combination
of shear and compression or tension, and the edges
are clamped or simply supported, and not necessarily all clamped
or all simply supported .  by an easy extension the
method of solution can also be used to find the periods of transverse
vibration of rectangular panels for the same types
of loading and edge fixing .
