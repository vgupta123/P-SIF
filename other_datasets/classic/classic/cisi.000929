The Trading Stamp Mentality
  A number of trips to the United States, to teach in library schools, have
inculcated in me a variety of views about the present state of American
library education.  They are personal opinions - no more - but they come
from one who has seen much that he admires and who believes wholeheartedly
that the American spirit includes  a firm resolution to change whatever
is inefficient or corrupt.  Otherwise, 1776 would have no meaning.  The
opinions do not stem directly from my experience in the five accredited
schools in which I have taught, but are strongly rooted in my general
observation of library education practice and my discussions with 
members of the library profession.
