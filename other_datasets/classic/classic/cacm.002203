Key-to-Address Transform Techniques: A Fundamental
Performance Study on Large Existing Formatted 
Files
The results of a study of eight different
key-to-address transformation methods applied to 
a set of existing files are presented.  As each method
is applied to a particular file, load factor and 
bucket size are varied over a wide range.  In addition,
appropriate variables pertinent only to a specific 
method take on different values.  The performance of
each method is summarized in terms of the number 
of accesses required to get to a record and the number
of overflow records created by a transformation. 
 Peculiarities of each method are discussed.  Practical
guidelines obtained from the results are stated. 
 Finally, a proposal for further quantitative fundamental study is outlined.
