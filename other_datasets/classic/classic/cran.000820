theories of plastic buckling .
  the theory for the plastic buckling of columns which appears
finally to have achieved a satisfactory form, rests upon the
well-established uniaxial stress-strain relation .  the development of
a correspondingly satisfactory theory for the plastic buckling of
plates has been hampered by the nonexistence of an established
polyaxial stress-strain relation in the plastic range .
  present theories for the polyaxial stress-strain relation beyond
the elastic range can be divided into two types, often called flow
and deformation theories .  theories of plastic buckling based on
deformation theories are in better agreement with experiment
than those based on flow theories .  on the other hand, tests in
which a material is compressed into the plastic range and then
subjected to shear at constant compressive stress are in better
agreement with flow than with deformation theories .  legitimate
doubt therefore has existed as to the validity of any theory for
the plastic buckling of plates .
  as a result of studying these apparent contradictions, a new
theory of plasticity has been developed which is of neither the
flow nor the deformation type .  it is based upon the concept of
slip, and its formulation was guided more by physical, and less
by mathematical, considerations than previous theories .
experimental evidence of limited scope but of crucial character is in
better agreement with the new theory than with either flow or
deformation theories .  the new theory accounts for the apparent
contradictions previously alluded to and justifies the use of
deformation theory in the analysis of the plastic buckling of plates .
