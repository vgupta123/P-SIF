control system and analysis and design via the second method of
lyapunov .
the/second method/of lyapunov is the most general approach currently in
the theory of stability of dynamic systems . after a rigorous exposition
 of the fundamental concepts of this theory, applications are made to/a/
stability of linear stationary, linear nonslationary, and nonlinear
systems,./b/estimation of transient behavior,./c/control-system
optimization,./d/design of relay servos . the discussion is essentially
self-contained, with emphasis on the thorough development of the
principal ideas and mathematical tools . only systems governed by
differential equations are treated here . systems governed by difference
equations are the subject of a companion paper .
