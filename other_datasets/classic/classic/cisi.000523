The Cost_Performance of an On-Line, Free-Text Bibliographic Retrieval System
   The cost-performance evaluation of the SUPARS system is reported.. SUPARS 
was an on-line, free-text bibliographic  retrieval system; cost-effectiveness 
data of such systems are not readily available.. In our evaluation, two 
measures of cost were employed: a computer processing charge expressed in 
dollars, and the number of documents retrieved (a measure of work that must be 
expended to review the retrieved items).. The measure of performance was an 
estimate of the recall ratio..
   To obtain the requisite measures an experimental plan was developed in which 
experts searched the data base of Psychological Abstracts forming their queries
from written statements of information needs.. These statements (along with the 
list of documents relevant to them) were produced by people with information
problems.. Tallies were kept of the number of documents retrieved before each 
of the designed relevant items were found.. The major findings are noted 
below..
   (1) Queries to the system employing simple Boolean operators (AND, OR) have
better cost-performance characteristics than queries using more elegant 
searching operators..
   (2) On-demand access to the index or dictionary contributes sizeably to
improving the cost-performance of the system..
   (3) The argument is raised that human factors, such as the differences among
users of a system, probably should be a major factor in the design, operation 
and evaluation of retrieval systems.. It appears that consideration of these 
factors will improve system cost-performance..
