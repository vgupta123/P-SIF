use of local similarity concepts in hypersonic viscous
interaction problems .
  the problem of predicting the characteristics
of a hypersonic laminar boundary layer that
interacts with the external flow field is approached
using the tangent wedge formulation for
the inviscid flow field and the method of similar
solutions for the viscous flow .  it is shown
that the concept of local similarity which allows
the pressure gradient parameter to vary in
the streamwise direction leads to an explicit
relation between the viscous and inviscid flows
for all values of the hypersonic interaction
parameter .  the conditions of /strong/ and
limits of the general relations .  the present theory
is compared with three independent experimental
investigations .  in each case, the
agreement is found to be excellent over the range of
investigated .  it is shown, using asymptotic
solutions to the exact boundary layer equations,
that the present theory is applicable to a wide
variety of viscous interaction problems .
a large number of solutions to the laminar
boundary layer similarity equations for a perfect
gas with cross flow and surface mass transfer are
given .  these numerical results, when combined
with the solutions of previous authors, are
sufficient to describe the range of conditions with high precision .
