the pressure gradient induced by shear flow past a
flat plate .
  article is a continuation of an earlier note on papers by li
on a semiinfinite plate in a uniform shear flow .  li had deduced
from the form of his equations that stream vorticity caused an
induced pressure gradient in the flow .  later papers by li and
murray (amr 15(1962), rev. 7157) support the induced pressure
gradient theory .  the author notes, however, that the mathematics used
by li and murray are not acceptable and the problem thus not
resolved .  the present note sets up simple models of complete flows
examinable by elementary means .  author holds that analyses
demonstrate conclusively that no pressure gradient is induced in
the boundary layer on a flat plate in a limited region of shear flow .
he notes that the original question in the case of unbounded shear
remains obscure--and anyway an unlimited shear layer is not of
great practical importance .
