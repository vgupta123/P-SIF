An Analytical Model of a Library Network
   Networks and network models of industrial and military systems have received 
much attention in operation research literature.. The extension of network
modeling to library networks provides some interesting twists of the usual 
models.. A general library network is offered, a mathematical statement of the 
network problem is given, and the solution of the problem is discussed.. An
example of the use of the model in evaluation and design situations is 
provided.. The necessity for further work in both theoretical and applied areas
is cited in the summary..
