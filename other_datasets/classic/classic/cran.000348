turbulent boundary layer in compressible fluids .
turbulent boundary layer in compressible fluids .
  the continuity, momentum, and energy differential equations
for turbulent flow of a compressible fluid are derived, and the
apparent turbulent stresses and dissipation function are
identified .  a general formula for skin friction, including heat
transfer to a flat plate, is developed for a thin turbulent boundary
layer in compressible fluids with zero pressure gradient .  curves
are presented giving skin-friction coefficients and heat-transfer
coefficients for air for various wall-to-free-stream temperature
ratios and free-stream mach numbers .
  in the special case when the boundary layer is insulated, this
general formula yields skin-friction coefficients higher than those
given by the von karman wall-property compressible-fluid
formula but lower than those given by the von karman
incompressible-fluid formula .  heat transfer from the boundary layer
to the plate generally increases the friction and heat-transfer
coefficients .
