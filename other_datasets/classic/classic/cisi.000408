Handbook of Data Processing for Libraries
  The purpose of this book, therefore, is to assist libraries and librarians in
resolving some of the problems faced in utilizing this new technology.  The
intent is to provide a concrete, factual guide to the principles and methods
available for the application of modern data processing to library operations.
For the operating librarian, it should be considered a handbook, a tool to
guide him in decisions concerning the introduction of data processing techniques
into his own library.  For the student, it should be a textbook, educating him
not only in methodology but also in the interrelationships between data 
processing and the library.  For the system designer, it should be a summary
of the state-of-the-art, serving as a bridge between library objectives and
the technology.  The book, throughout, lays special stress on the library and,
particularly, on the significance of library values and policies for determining
the choice of system.  The book gives emphasis to the computer, but always in
the context of applying this technology to the solution of operating problems,
as an addition to resources for information service, as a tool of good
management, and not as an end in itself.  At most, therefore, the book aims to
educate the profession in the use of these tools, and in the special problems
of applying them to libraries.  In this respect, much of the groundwork has
already been done - the profession has been educating itself, has carried out
analyses of library operations, has experimented with mechanization, and is
developing better concepts of cost control.  The book merely continues a
process that is already underway.
