Development of Methodologic Tools for Planning and
Managing Library Services:
III. Standardized Inventories of Library Services
   A standardized procedure was developed for eliciting those details for a
library's service policies that are important to its users and for recording
the data by checking appropriate categories on a form.. This inventory 
procedure covers the entire spectrum of user services and accommodates a wide
range of policies.. The inventory was originally designed for use by trained
interviewers in large-scale surveys of academic medical libraries.. However,
it is also suitable for other kinds of libraries, and the Interview Guide and
Checklist can be used for a self-survey by library stuff.. In addition to 
survey use, the inventory has a variety of educational, administrative,
managerial, and research applications.. A methods for weighting the categorical
inventory data to reflect the relative desirability of different policies makes 
it possible to calculate scores indicating how a library's policies compare
with those of an "optimal" library.. An analogous inventory of the services a 
library provides to other libraries was developed for surveying major backup
resources in the medical library system..
