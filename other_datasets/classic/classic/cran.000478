tabulation of the blasius function with blowing and
suction .
  authors tabulate solutions of f''' + ff'' = 0 for the velocity
distribution in a boundary layer .  for each solution f'(0) = 0,
the third boundary condition is the specification
of f(0) .  f(n) and its first three derivatives are tabulated to 5d
in gaps of 0.1 in n for f(0) = -1.23849, -1.2(0.05) 0.5 (0.1) 1.5,
introduction gives method of solution and
physical meaning of boundary conditions, etc .  lock's (amr
