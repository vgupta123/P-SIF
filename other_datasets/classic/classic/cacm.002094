On an Algorithm for Nonlinear Minimax Approximation
Certain nonlinear minimax approximation problems are characterize
d by properties which permit the application of special algorithms,
mainly based on the exchange algorithms of Remes (1934, 1935), for
their solution.  In this paper the application to problems of this
type of a general nonlinear algorithm due to Osborne and Watson
(1969) is considered.  Examples are given to illustrate that this
algorithm can give satisfactory results and, in particular, can
successfully solve problems which lead to difficulties
with the more conventional specialist method.
