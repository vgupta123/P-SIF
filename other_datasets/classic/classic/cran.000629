second-order effects in laminar boundary layers .
  second-order boundary layer disturbances are
due to the displacement of the main flow by
the boundary layer, surface curvature, freestream
vorticity, and slip .  a procedure for finding
these is given for compressible flow of a perfect gas
having a classically similar boundary layer .
solutions are given for the flat plate and circular
cylinder and for the hypersonic axisymmetric
stagnation point .  for the latter flow, the dominant
effect is that of vorticity, which increases
both shear and heat flux .  for the plate or cylinder,
the same conclusion tends to hold for high
speed flow .  the vorticity effect is governed by the
entire outer flow--not just the wall vorticity .
