Indexing and Abstracting by Association
This article discusses the possibility of exploiting the
statistics of word co-occurrence in text for purposes of
document retrieval. Co-occurrence is defined and related
to the mental processes of authors and readers; several
means of quantitative measurement of word co-occurrence
are then scrutinized.  It is shown that the most
strongly co-occurring word pairs, which are therefore
"associated" in a statistical sense, can be represented
in the form of an "association map."  The last half of the
article presents two modes of use of association maps
in literature searching.
