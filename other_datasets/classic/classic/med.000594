hormonal modification of the distribution of 1-amino-
cyclopentanecarboxylic acid-1-c14 in the rat
four hormones have been examined for their ability to alter the distribution
in the rat of the new model amino acid,
1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid-1-c14.  although
the total tissue concentrations of this
amino acid were considerably less than those
found previously for a-aminoisobutyric acid,
the changes produced by the hormones were
much the same for both amino acids.  hydrocortisone
elevated the liver level of 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic
acid within 2
hr.  bovine growth hormone accelerated entry of
the amino acid into both skeletal muscle and
liver of hypophysectomized rats within 1
hr.  testosterone propionate elevated its distribution
ratio in the kidney but not in skeletal
muscle, whereas b-estradiol significantly increased
uptake of the model amino acid only
by the immature uterus.  only growth hormone
produced a significant change in the serum
level of 1-aminocyclopentanecarboxylic acid
under the conditions used.
