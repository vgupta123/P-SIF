Copyright Aspects of Computer Usage
This paper is concerned with the question of
what constitutes infringement of a copyright on 
a book or other nondramatic literary work when the work
is fed into a computer and is indexed, analyzed, 
partially reprinted, or otherwise utilized by the computer
to produce eye-readable output.  The question 
of copyrightability of programs and infringement of copyrights
on programs is also discussed.  The paper 
is directed primarily to a discussion of the present
law.  Some aspects of the proposed new copyright 
law are also included.  General recommendations are
made with respect to the proposed revision of the 
copyright law.
