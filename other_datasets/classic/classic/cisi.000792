Photocopies v. Periodicals
Cost-Effectiveness in the Special Library
   Evidence provided by the Dainton Report indicates that special libraries in
the UK are far from fully exploiting the photocopying services provided by the
national libraries.. As these photocopying services are legally obliged to 
operate at cost, they offer significant economies to any special library which 
exploits them systematically..
   This paper describes a simple graphical method of estimating the savings 
that can be made, or the extended subject coverage that can be obtained at no
additional cost, by substituting photocopies for relevant papers in the 
peripheral periodicals relating to any well-defined scientific or technical
subject..
   Though photocopying charges must be realistic, the confident exploitation of 
the national photocopying services depends on the avoidance of arbitrary jumps in
photocopying charges..
