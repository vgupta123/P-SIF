Citation Measures of Hard Science, Soft Science, Technology and Nonscience
  Perhaps the fundamental problem of those that work in the scientific
information industry is that it is not just that special part of an information
industry that happens to deal with material having a scientific content.  
Technical librarianship involves much more than librarianship applied to 
books with an esoteric vocabulary and much mathematics.
  My reason for choosing this problem as a contribution for such a strategic
conference is that I know well as an historian of science that the greatest and
most useful advances in our technologies have not come from the applied
research of trained people trying to make themselves useful to society, but
rather from basic research aimed at furthering understanding and curiousity,
and powered by the latest instrumentation that the useful people have devised.
I suspect that all the new indexing tools and computer handlings will be more
useful to basic research in understanding scientists than they will to
solving practical problems for which they are designed.  It seems clear,
however, that it is only such new understanding that can bring success,
whatever solutions ultimately emerge.
