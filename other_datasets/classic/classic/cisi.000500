Cost-Effectiveness as a Guide in Developing Indexing Rules
   To date, the many decisions among alternatives that are required in the 
course of developmental efforts to improve indexing have, with few exceptions, 
been guided primarily by criteria related to effectiveness, as measured by some 
objective method, or as judged subjectively.. Although effectiveness-type 
criteria may be adequate for work intended solely to advance the 
state-of-the-art, when the goal is to develop indexing techniques appropriate 
for operating services, it seems highly desirable to employ some criterion that 
takes cost as well as effectiveness into consideration.. The central problem of 
operating services can be reduced to either that of producing the best indexing 
possible at a given cost, or that of producing indexing of a given level of 
effectiveness at least cost.. In our current effort to develop rules for human, 
machine, and man-machine indexing, we employ a cost-effectiveness type of 
criterion in making the critical developmental decision.. The general approach
is described  and illustrated with examples of how measures of cost and of 
effectiveness  were considered jointly in decision making, primarily for how to
reduce cost of indexing at a given level of effectiveness.. Problems of 
defining cost are also discussed, such as how to divide indexing into discrete 
steps, the effects of long-term vs. short-term activity in humans and 
small-batch vs. large-batch considerations for machines..
