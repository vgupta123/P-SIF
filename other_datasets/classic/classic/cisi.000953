Characteristics of the Research Literature Used by Chemists and
Physicists in The United States, Part II
  This is the second of two papers dealing with the characteristics of the
literature used by research chemists and physicists in the United States.  
The method of the study was fully outlined in th first article and will
therefore not be repeated here.   The previous paper was devoted to a
discussion of the importance of the literature of various subject fields to
research in chemistry and physics.  The remarks that follow are directed
primarily to a discussion of the temporal span of the literature, the principal
forms of the literature, the national origins of the literature used in the 
United States, and some attention is devoted to the more important serial
titles.
