lift on inclined bodies of revolution in hypersonic flow .
the importance of body lift lies in the fact that at moderate angles of
attack and high mach number it can constitute an appreciable part of
the total lift of a winged missile . in this paper an attempt has been
made to analyze body lift in hypersonic flow by an approximate method
and, together with a correlation of existing experimental data, to
indicate the probable variation of body lift over a wide range of mach
numbers extending from low supersonic to hypersonic . the method of
analysis of hypersonic flow over inclined bodies of revolution employed
herein has been denoted as the hypersonic approximation . it is an
improvement on the newtonian corpuscular theory of aerodynamics, since it
considers the centrifugal forces resulting from the curved paths of the
air particles in addition to the impact /newtonian/ forces .
