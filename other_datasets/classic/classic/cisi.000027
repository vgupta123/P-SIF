Cost Analysis and Simulation Procedures for the Evaluation
of Large Information Systems
A computer program has been written and used which
simulates the several-year operation of an information
system and computes estimates of the expected
operating costs as well as the amount of equipment
and personnel required during that time period.  The
program has been used for the analysis of several
large systems and has proven itself to be a useful
research tool for the study of systems with so many
components and interrelated operations that an
equivalent manual analysis would be extremely
cumbersome and time consuming,and perhaps even
impractical. This paper describes this program and
shows, as an example, some of the results of a simulation
of two of several suggested designs for a specific
information system.
