The Development, Cost, and Impact of a Current Awareness Service in an
Industrial Town
  The development of a current awareness system in The Dow Chemical Company 
has resulted in four established services, one based on internal information and
the other three on Chemical Abstracts.  In addition several other services are 
now being tried or considered.  The operation of such a service is expensive, 
but the willingness of the user to pay for it and responses to a survey indicate
that it is a useful and worthwhile tool to the scientist and engineer.  The
use of such services also has a significant effect on other established
information services.
