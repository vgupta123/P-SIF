Personnel Administration in Libraries
    Since 1958 when the first edition of the present work was
issued, additional studies, research programs and experimentation
have contributed to changes in personnel work and the large area
of human relations.  The impact of these developments has been
and should be felt in libraries as well as in industry, government
and business.  The present edition views all the aspects of personnel
work in the context of the most useful of the newer developments.
