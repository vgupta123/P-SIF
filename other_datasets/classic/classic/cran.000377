a turbulent analog of the stewartson-illingworth transformation .
  the stewartson-illingworth transformation is applied to the
integral momentum equation for compressible boundary-layer
flow, leaving the x-coordinate transformation unspecified,
however .  it is shown that the transformed equation is the integral
momentum equation for incompressible flow if (a) the effect of
compressibility on the boundary-layer shape parameter h can be
represented by
and (b) the x-coordinate transformation is chosen to be suitably
related to the ratio of skin-friction coefficients in compressible
and incompressible flows .
  experimental evidence is presented which shows that
condition (a) is satisfied for turbulent boundary layers up to m = 5 .
an x-transformation is chosen according to (b) and an equation is
presented which gives the turbulent boundary-layer growth in
compressible flow in terms of a simple quadrature .  the
predictions of this equation are then compared with some
measurements on wind-tunnel nozzles .
