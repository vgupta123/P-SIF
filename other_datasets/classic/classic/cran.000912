the axisymmetric free-convection temperature field
along a vertical thin cylinder .
  with a view to studying the effect of strong transverse
curvature on boundary-layer problems, the axisymmetric free-
convection problem along a vertical thin cylinder is investigated
theoretically as well as experimentally .  a theory is developed
as an extension of the pohlhausen solution of a thick
axisymmetric laminar boundary layer by mark and by glauert and
lighthill .  experiments consist of a thermocouple survey of the
temperature field over an electrically-heated brass cylinder of
diameter and 10 ft. height and an interferometric study
of the density field over a bare tungsten wire of 0.02-in. diameter
and 5 ft. height .  the thermal-layer thicknesses are about five
and fifty times the radii of the cylinders, respectively .
experimental results of the local heat-transfer coefficient are in excellent
agreement with the theory .  this, in turn, justifies the theories
of laminar boundary layer along a thin cylinder, at least indirectly .
