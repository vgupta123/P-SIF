Change in Academic Libraries
Never noted for their willingness to accept innovative suggestions and 
implement change from outside sources, academic libraries have remained 
institutions in which changes in service policies and programs originated from 
internal sources only.. In order to shift to an orientation that seeks to 
develop new and expanding service programs, the establishment to research 
groups could do much to improve both the services offered by a library and its
role in the academic community.. While certain constraints always limit 
modification or the initiation of services, a properly constituted research 
group could do much to generate a climate for change, provide feedback to the 
library, and successfully continue to develop new and more effective library 
and information services..
