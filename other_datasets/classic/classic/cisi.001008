The Measurement and Evaluation of Reference Service
        The measurement and evaluation of reference service
has been more often discussed than attempted.  In fact, the 
literature of this subject has itself spawned a fair-sized 
literature of review.
        Admittedly, the task is formidable.  As compared with 
other library activities such as circulation, acquisitions, and
cataloging, reference service is ill-defined, with little
agreement on its component parts.  Is inter-library lending an
integral part of reference work because many reference librarians
are responsible for it?  Formal instruction in the use of books
and libraries?  The supervision of reference reading rooms?  The
preparation of indexes?  And having decided what the genus 
"reference librarian" does, how can one readily determine the
effectiveness of his work or its impact?  Reference librarians
may have acted rather blindly in approaching their elephant of a
problem, but it is undeniably a big one.
