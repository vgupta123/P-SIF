Compound Words: A Problem in Post-Coordinate Retrieval Systems
   Compound words cause some difficulty in post-coordinate indexing
systems:  if too many are fractured, or the wrong categories are selected
for fracturing, noise will be produced at unacceptable levels on retrieval..
Various prior suggestions for handling compound terms are examined which
include those for pre-coordinated or rotated, indexes..
   The syntactic origins are also explored and it is found that many
compound words hinge on a prepositional relationship between the components,
and that this relationship can be applied to decision making.. Other
compound words are in effect abbreviated statements from longer phrases, 
while some are influenced by the presence of a verb-like form..
   These syntactic influences, together with some of the philosophy from
earlier studies - especially that of the 'force' required to fracture a
term, have been combined to produce a set of rules which have been
employed at the National Rubber Producers' Research Association (NRPRA)
for over two years.. These have greatly eased decision making and have
enabled the thesaural vocabulary to be made more consistent..
   It is also suggested that the rules have some bearing on the
application of roles especially if these are employed on a pre-coordinate
basis..
