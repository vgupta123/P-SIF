interference between the wings and tail plane of a
slender wing-body tailplane combination .
  an approximate method of predicting the interference between
the wings and the tailplane of a slender wing-body-tailplane
combination in an inviscid flow is developed, in order to explain the change
in centre of pressure position with incidence which has been found to
occur in wind tunnel and flight tests on guided weapons .  incidence
changes in one plane only, normal to the plane containing the wings
and the tail surfaces, have been considered .
  the method is based on slender body theory and the assumption
that the wing trailing vortices roll-up completely before they reach
the tailplane,. it is, therefore, applicable to weapons equipped with
low aspect ratio wings far separated from the tail surfaces .  when
the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio, an
analytical solution is given for the effect of the wing downwash field on
the tail lift .  for high aspect ratio, rectangular tail surfaces it
is suggested by comparison with experimental data, that the tail lift
may be estimated approximately from the value of the mean downwash
angle across the tail span .
  a summary of the method is given in para.5 which, in conjunction
with the introduction, may be read independently of the rest of the
report .
