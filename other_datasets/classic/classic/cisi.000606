Interface Design for An Interactive Information Retrieval System:
A Literature Survey and a Research System Description
   This article focuses on the human interaction characteristics of an
information retrieval system, suggests some design considerations to
improve man-machine cooperation, and describes a research system at 
Stanford that is exploring some of these techniques..
   Librarians can only be of limited assistance in helping the naive
user formulate an unstructured feeling in his mind into an appropriate
search query that maps into the retrieval system.. Consequently, the
process of query formulation by the user, interactively with the
information available in te system, remains one of the principal
problems in information retrieval today..
   In an attempt to solve this problem by improving the interface
communication between man and the computer, we have pursued the
objective of displaying hierarchically structured index trees on a CRT
in a decision tree format permitting the user merely to point (with a
light pen) at alternatives which seem most appropriate to him.. Using
his passive rather than his active vocabulary expands his interaction
vocabulary by at least an order of magnitude.. Moreover, a 
hierarchically displayed index is a modified thesaurus, and may be
augmented by adding lateral links to provide semantic assistance to
the user.. A hierarchical structure was chosen because it seems to
replicate the structure of cognitive thought processes most closely, 
thus allowing the simplest, most direct transfer of the man's problem
into the structure and vocabulary of the system..
