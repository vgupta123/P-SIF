Information, Mechanism, and Meaning
  In a day when it is hard enough in most fields of science to
keep abreast of new and non-redundant literature, the
publication of collected papers, like the estate of holy
matrimony, is something not to be undertaken 'unadvisedly,
lightly or wantonly'.  In the present case it would not have been
considered at all but for the kindly initiative of my respected
friend Professor Roman Jakobson, whose persistent encouragement
alone overcame that distaste which most of us feel
for our ten- to twenty-year-old productions and brought this
first volume to the point of no return.  It is true that these
exploratory papers were scattered among an unconscionably 
awkward selection of publications for anyone wanting to
follow them up.  On the other hand, as most of them were
written for specific occasions, each of which demanded some
rehearsal of points covered in earlier essays, the resulting
repetitiveness presented a special problem.  With occasional
exceptions, redundancy could have been eliminated only
at the cost of mutilating individual papers.  The solution
adopted has been to leave almost all repetitive passages
intact, offsetting in small print those that can be skipped
without loss by readers of the earlier chapters.  Where some
comment has seemed necessary, by way of foreword or 
postscript to the original papers, the passages added have
been italicized.
