Methods of Information Handling
  This book is meant to be an aid and reference work
for those people who are interested in the design of
information systems.  Such information systems are
typified by the traditional libraries, but the same
problems of information processing, storage, and
retrieval are present in many government and
industrial organizations in many places besides the
library.  This book provides an illustration of the
tools, equipment, and methodology that might be
applied to those problems.
