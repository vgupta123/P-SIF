on structural fatigue under random loading .
  experience has shown that the fluctuating loads induced by a
jet may cause fatigue failure of aircraft structural components .
in order to throw some light on this and similar problems, the
stress spectrum and the /equivalent fatigue stress/ of an elastic
structure subjected to random loading are studied .  the analysis
is simplified by assuming the structure to have only a single
degree of freedom and by using the concept of cumulative damage,
the results being expressed in terms of quantities that can be
directly measured .  as an example, a similarity expression for
the probable value of the equivalent fatigue stress of a panel
subjected to jet buffeting is derived .
