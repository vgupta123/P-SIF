flow studies on flat plate delta wings at supersonic
speeds .
  an experimental study has been made to investigate some aspects
of the nature of the flow around delta wings .  vapor-screen,
pressure-distribution, and ink-flow studies were made at a mach number of 1.9 on
a series of semispan delta-wing models with slender wedge airfoil
sections and very sharp leading edges .  the models had semiapex angles
ranging from 5 to 31.75 .
  separated regions of vorticity existed along the chords of all
the wings in the series tested .  concentrated vortex cores were found
only on wings of very small semiapex angles .  for wings with medium
and large semiapex angles, the separated vorticity was concentrated in
a region extending over the outboard part of the span and lying close
to the wing upper surface .
  the results show that theoretical aerodynamic calculations, such
as those in naca tn 3430, utilizing a single, separated vortex pair
above the wing upper surface to represent the separated vorticity can
be applied at supersonic speeds for very slender wings .
