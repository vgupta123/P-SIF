on the plk method and the supersonic blunt-body problem .
  detailed analysis of the subsonic and transonic portious of the
flow field about either very blunt or asymmetric configurations
requires successive approximations,. these can be carried out in a
systematic fashion only when an appropriate convergent
perturbation procedure is available .  the problem of producing
successively refined sets of initial conditions for either /direct/
or /inverse/ analysis of the flow is formulated in the following
terms ..  given reasonable estimates for shock shape and
pressure distribution on the body, can one determine the flow field
of interest to any desired degree of approximation by a
perturbation approach .qm
  a procedure to this effect is developed which involves
stretching of coordinates in the spirit of the poincare-lighthill-kuo
are transformed along body, shock, and intermediate lines so as
to annul perturbations of the local resultant velocity,. (b) for the
integral method the coordinate along the boundary of each strip
is shifted so as to control perturbations of the velocity component
that determines the critical point .
  the approach is justified by a study of the equations governing
the direct method, and by consideration of model transonic flow
problems for which closed form solutions are available .  the
range of validity of the proposed procedure is assessed by
practical application and comparison with experiment,. results are
presented for a disk set normal to a low-termperature air stream
at m = 4.76, and for a highly asymmetric two-dimensional
configuration at m = 8 .
