The Design of the Venus Operating System
The Venus Operating System is an experimental
multiprogramming system which supports five or 
six concurrent users on a small computer.  The system was
produced to test the effect of machine architecture 
on complexity of software.  The system is defined by
a combination of microprograms and software.  The 
microprogram defines a machine with some unusual architectural
feature; the software exploits these features 
to define the operating system as simply as possible.
 In this paper the development of the system is 
described, with particular emphasis on the principles which guided the design.
