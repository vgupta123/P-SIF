numerical solution of the navier-stokes equations for the flow around a
circular cylinder at reynolds number 40 .
the steady two-dimensional flow around a circular cylinder submerged in
a viscous fluid for the case r 40 is investigated, integrating
numerically the exact navier-stokes equations . the main results are as
follows . /i/ the steady flow solution exists even for the reynolds
number as high as 40 . moreover, it seems that the solution goes over
smoothly to the solution of the kirchhoff discontinuous flow theory
which seems to be the limiting flow for the case r . /ii/ the flow
pattern and the coefficients of pressure and drag are in good agreement
with the experimental data .
