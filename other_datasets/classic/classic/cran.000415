the aerodynamic design of section shapes for swept wings .
the aerodynamic design of section shapes for swept wings .
an extension of work of lock and rogers and the result of cooperation by
n.p.l., r.a.e. and members of the british aircraft industry to achieve a
 satisfactory design for an aircraft cruising at low supersonic speeds .
 knowledge of shock-wave prediction, onset of wave drag and
shock-induced separation allows the basic design to be generalized for a wide
range of parameters . unpublished work by bagley on the relation of
aerodynamic coefficients and geometry is used . the role of upper
surface velocity distribution is noted and methods for predicting pressure
distributions with shock waves are reviewed for both subsonic and
transonic flows .
