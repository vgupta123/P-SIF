DITRAN-A Compiler Emphasizing Diagnostics
DITRAN (Diagnostic FORTRAN) is an implementation
of ASA Basic FORTRAN with rather extensive 
error checking capabilities both at compilation time
and during execution of a program.  The need for 
improved diagnostic capabilities and some objectives
to be met by any compiler are discussed.  Attention 
is given to the design and implementation of DITRAN
and the particular techniques employed to provide 
the diagnostic features.  The handling of error messages
by a general macro approach is described.  Special 
features which provide teaching aids for use by instructors are noted.
