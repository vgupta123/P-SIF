Classification Catalogue Code
  The Author, the Dictionary and the Classified catalogues
represent three successive stages in the order of evolution
of the internal form of the Library Catalogue.  The classified
form being the latest to evolve, the literature relating
to it is comparatively scanty.  It is strikingly so in the
form of a systematic code of rules for cataloguing.  While
the number of codes for the Author Catalogue is fairly
large and the number for the Dictionary Catalogue is also
respectable, there appear to be few systematic and complete
codes published in book-form for the Classified Catalogue.
Hence this little venture, which is based on twenty-five
years of experimentation and on the valuable reciprocal
influence gained by its being taught to students of library
science during the last twenty years.
  While the Call Numbers occurring in the examples given
are constructed by the Colon Classification, the rules of
this Code are not necessarily dependent on that scheme for
their applicability.  They are all of general application,
irrespective of the scheme of classification in use.
