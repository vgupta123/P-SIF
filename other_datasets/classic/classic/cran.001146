thermal buckling of cylinders .
thermal buckling of cylinders .
several theoretical and experimental investigations on the buckling
of cylinders due to both axial and circumferential thermal stresses are
reviewed .  differences that exist among the various results are
discussed and areas of future work are indicated .
