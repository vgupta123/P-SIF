inviscid-incompressible flow theory of static peripheral
jets in proximity to the ground .
  an /exact/ flow theory of peripheral jets issuing
symmetrically from a hovering aerial-ground vehicle is presented .  the
theory is exact insofar as no simplifying assumptions have been
made in obtaining a solution of the governing inviscid,
two-dimensional hydrodynamical flow equations .  the results are
valid for all jet thickness vehicle height ratios .  the limit of
applicability of existing theories (very low thickness height
ratios) are defined .  jet reaction, lift, and power coefficients for
static conditions are introduced and computed .  lift
augmentation and lift power ratios are also calculated .
  applications to three-dimensional vehicles with rotational
symmetry are indicated .
