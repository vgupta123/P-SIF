Structure and Effectiveness of The Citation Identifier, an
Operational Computer Program for Automatic Identification of Case
Citations in Legal Literature
   A computer program for automatic identification of "full form" case
citations in legal literature (e.g., Rutherford v. Geddes, 4 Wall. 220,
18 L. Ed. 343; Southland Industries, Inc. v. Federal Communications
Commission, 1938, 69 App. D.C., 82, 99 F.2D 117) has been developed
by this group and is now operational.. 
   The level of performance of this program known as "The Citation
Identifier" is high.. In a recent computer run, The Citation
Identifier scanned ther full texts of 191 randomly selected decisions
of U.S. Court of Appeals (some 400,000 words of running text) and 
located correctly 2,220 full-form citations out of a total of 2,227
(that is, better than 99% of the total).. Only seven misses and three
false drops occurred..
   Of 2,220 full-form citations located correctly, 1944 (87%) were
identified perfectly.. In addition, there were 276 partial identifications
containing two types of errors:  (1) partial identifications in which some
citation terms were mistakenly lopped off by the program ("short hits");
and (2) partial identifications that contained words improperly included
in the citations ("long hits").
   Both types of errors are, for the most part, easily correctible and
can be largely eliminated by suitable changes in the program..
   The Citation Identifier operates rather rapidly.. In a recent test run,
the total time required to process some 400,000 running words of text
was approximately 15 1/2 minutes.. This speed could be further increased
by suitable changes in the computer program..
   An extension of The Citation Identifier to reduced-form citations (e.g.,
"the Geddes decision", "the Southland Industries case") is now in preparation..
