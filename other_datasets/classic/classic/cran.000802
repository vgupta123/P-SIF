the behaviour of supersonic flow past a body of revolution
far from the axis .
a theory is developed of the supersonic flow past a body of revolution
at large distances from the axis, where a linearized approximation is
valueless owing to the divergence of the characteristics at infinity .
it is used to find the asymptotic forms of the equations of the shocks
which are formed from the neighbourhoods of the nose and tail .  in the
special case of a slender pointed body, the general theory at large
distances is used to modify the linearized approximation to give a
theory which is uniformly valid at all distances from the axis .  the
results which are of physical importance are summarized in the
conclusion (9) and compared with the results of experimental
observations .
