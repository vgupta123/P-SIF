Efficiency Criteria for the Operation of Large Libraries
  It is rather surprising that behavioral scientists have not discovered 
libraries much sooner in their search for institutional environments suited for
the testing of theoretical hypotheses. Librarians and their assistants respect 
research and scholarship and are inclined to go far beyond the call of duty in 
helping the investigator, even when they are skeptical (rightfully, in most 
instances) of the usefulness of such research for the
improvement of their own organizations.
Data and related information are necessarily treated with greater precision and
discipline in libraries than in factories and most bureaucratic offices; 
therefore, significant results can often be obtained
with smaller samples and in shorter periods
of observation.  People working in libraries do not feel they should curtail
disclosures about basic processes.  Elsewhere professional employees are 
obligated to preserve trade secrets from competitors
or to suppress facts which might be considered scandalous by legislative
committees.  At least as important to an investigator is the fact that one or 
more libraries almost always lie close at hand - there could hardly be any 
more convenient institution.
