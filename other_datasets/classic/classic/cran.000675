pressure distribution and surface flow on 5( and 9( thick wings with
curved tip and 60degree sweepback .
extensive tables are given of pressure coefficients measured at reynolds
 numbers from 1.3x10 to 3.9x10 on two half-models of identical planform
with 5( rae 101 and 9( rae 101 streamwise sections . the planform of
aspect ratio 3.899 has a straight trailing edge with 60degree of
sweepback, constant chord over most of the span and a parabolic outer portion
of the leading edge curving to a pointed tip . the overall wing
characteristics are obtained from integrated normal pressures and are
compared with lifting-surface theory .
the low-speed experimental pressure distributions and surface oil-flow
patterns are analysed and discussed in relation to the onset of
separation and the distinct vortex flows that develop at high
incidence . series of contrasting upper-surface isobars illustrate some
features of the different stalling processes of the two wings . the
direct influence of the main vortex on local surface pressures is
assessed in general terms . a fuller appraisal of secondary surface flow
 is obtained from the oil patterns, observations in water and
measurements of high suction near the trailing edge .
studies of the extent of leading-edge stall and location of part-span
vortices, in particular two simultaneous leading-edge vortices on the
thinner wing, follow from further analysis of local surface pressures .
after a detailed discussion of the effect of reynolds number and the
distinct types of separated flow, a few results with leading-edge
roughness are considered in relation to scale effect on separation and
the extensive influence of part-span roughness .
