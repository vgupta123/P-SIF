an experimental investigation of leading edge shock wave boundary layer
interaction at mach 5.8 .
the boundary layer on a slender body tends to be very thick at
hypersonic speeds . it interacts with the external flow by producing larger
flow deflections near the leading edge than those due to the body alone
flow around the boundary layer gives rise to an induced pressure with a
negative gradient which thins the boundary layer and increases the skin
friction with respect to the zero pressure gradient value .
experiments on a flat plate with a sharp leading edge have been
performed in the galcit 5-dash by 5-dash in. mach 5.8 hypersonic wind
tunnel . the induced pressure was measured by means of orifices in the
plate surface . profiles of mach number, velocity, mass flow, pressure,
and momentum deficiency were calculated from impact pressure surveys
normal to the plate surface made at various distances from the leading
edge .
the results are as follows . /1/ the induced pressures are 25 per cent
higher than the weak interaction theory . /2/ the boundary layer and the
 external flow are distinctly separate for as low as 6,000 . /3/ the
shock wave location is in good agreement with that predicted by the
friedrichs theory for a body shape equivalent to the observed
boundary-layer displacement thickness . /4/ expansion waves reflected from the
shock are weak . /5/ the average skin-friction coefficient tends toward
and nearly matches the zero pressure gradient value downstream, but
increases to approximately twice that value as the leading edge is
approached .
