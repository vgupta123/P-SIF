Feasibility Study of a Scheme for Reconciling Thesauri 
Covering a Common Subject
   The feasibility is examined of devising a scheme for operating a joint 
keyword system in a given subject area using several independently compiled 
thesauri.. It is suggested that if the individual keywords of each 
participating thesaurus represent indentifiable concepts, and these concepts are
given unique code numbers, then the code numbers enable the keywords of any
participating thesaurus to be converted into the appropriate keywords of any
other participant.. Incompatibilities between keywords systems arise from 
differences in the selection and form of keywords.. Eleven types of 
incompatibility are identified and a method of reconciliation is proposed for 
each.. The types of incompatibility that can arise in a single language include 
those that arise between one language and another, so that a multilingual joint 
system presents no additional problems..
