Thesaural Problems in an On-Line System
   This paper describes the construction of a synonym thesaurus or entry 
vocabulary for the SUNY Biomedical Communication Network, which will permit
the user greater ease of access to MeSH-indexed material without previously
consulting a printed list of indexed terms.. In order to discover the actual
terminalogy used by a researcher, words were extracted from titles of articles
appearing in Index Medicus, and compared with the subject heading under which
they appeared.. As well as strict synonyms, grammatical variants were also 
included.. Work is continuing on relating other indexing vocabularies, such as
Excerpta Medica and Current Medical Terminalogy, used in the biomedical world 
to MeSH terms..
