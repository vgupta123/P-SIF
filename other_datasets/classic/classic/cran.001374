theoretical analysis of turbulent mixing of reactive
gases with application to supersonic combustion of
hydrogen .
  the turbulent mixing of an axisymmetric jet of a
reactive gas is considered .  by assuming a
convenient model for the compressible eddy viscosity,
the momentum equation is reduced to a form
amenable to approximate solution .  the resulting
velocity distribution in both incompressible and
compressible flows is in reasonable agreement with
experiment .  the usual assumptions with
respect to chemical behavior, namely either frozen or
equilibrium flow, and to unity lewis numbers
and prandtl number are employed .  the theoretical
results for chemical equilibrium are shown
to be in reasonable agreement with experimental data
from low speed hydrogen flames .  a
numerical example of interest in connection with a hypersonic,
air breathing vehicle is carried out in detail .
