the juxtaglomerular cells of the kidney and the
zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex in
the sodium losing and the hypertensive
forms of virilizing adrenal
hyperplasia
pathological and biochemical observations
are presented in two cases of virilizing ad-
renal hyperplasia: one of the sodium-losing
type and the other of the hypertensive type.
examination of the kidneys revealed hyper-
trophy of the juxtaglomerular cells in the
case exhibiting excessive sodium loss.  the
adrenal cortex showed hypertrophy of the
zona glomerulosa.  it is hypothesized that
the chronic state of sodium loss caused
changes in the intravascular compartment
which led to compensatory activity of the
juxtaglomerular cells with resultant stimula-
tion of the zona glomerulosa.
examination of the hypertensive case
(known to involve a different enzyme defi-
cit) showed hypertrophy of the zona glom-
erulosa without hypertrophy of the juxta-
glomerular cells.  the intrinsic overproduc-
tion of sodium-retaining steroids associated
with the genetic defect in this clinical form
could account for both the hypertension
and the absence of hypertrophy of the juxta-
glomerular apparatus.
