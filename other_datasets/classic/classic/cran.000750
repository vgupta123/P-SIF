transonic flow in two dimensional and axially symmetrical
nozzles .
  by means of suitable expansions
in inverse powers of r, the
radius of curvature of the nozzle profile
at the throat measured in throat
half-heights, the velocity components
in the throat region of a
convergent-divergent nozzle can be
calculated .  the first three terms of
the series solution have been obtained
both for two-dimensional and for
axially-symmetric nozzles .  the
numerical accuracy of the solution is
confirmed by comparison with the
known exact solution along the branchline .
