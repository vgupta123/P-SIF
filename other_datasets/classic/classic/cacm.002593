A Back-end Computer for Data Base Management
It is proposed that the data base management
function be placed on a dedicated back-end computer 
which accepts commands (in a relatively high level language
such as the CODASYL Data Base Task Group, 
April 1971 Report) from a host computer, accesses the
data base on secondary storage, and returns results. 
 The advantages of such a configuration are discussed.  An
experimental implementation, called the experimental 
Data Management System, XDMS, is described and certain
conclusions about the back-end approach are drawn 
from this implementation.
