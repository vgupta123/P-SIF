Nonlinear Regression and the Solution of Simultaneous Equations
If one has a set of observables (Z1,...,Zm) which
are bound in a relation with certain parameters 
(A1,...,An) by an equation S(Z1,...;A1,...)=0, one frequently
has the problem of determining a set of 
values of the Ai which minimizes the sum of squares of
differences between observed and calculated values 
of a distinguished observable, say Zm.  If the solution
of the above equation for Zm,  Zm=N(Z1,...;A1,...) 
gives rise to a function N which is nonlinear in the Ai,
then one may rely on a version of Gaussian regression 
[1,2] for an iteration scheme that converges to a minimizing
set of values.  It is shown here that this 
same minimization technique may be used for the solution
of simultaneous (not necessarily linear) equations.
