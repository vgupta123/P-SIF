Interference Between Communicating Parallel Processes
Various kinds of interference between communicating
parallel processes have been examined by 
Dijkstra, Knuth, and others.  Solutions have been given
for the mutual exclusion problem and associated 
subproblems, in the form of parallel programs, and informal
proofs of correctness have been given for 
these solutions.  In this paper a system of parallel
processes is regarded as a machine which proceeds 
from one state S (i.e. a collection of pertinent data
values and process configurations) to a next state 
S' in accordance with a transition rule S --> S'.  A
set of such rules yields sequences of states, which 
dictate the system's behavior.  The mutual exclusion problem
and the associated subproblems are formulated 
as questions of inclusion between sets of states, or
of the existence of certain sequences.  A mechanical 
proof procedure is shown, which will either verify (prove
the correctness of ) or discredit (prove the 
incorrectness of) an attempted solution, with respect
to any of the interference properties.  It is shown 
how to calculate transition rules from the "partial
rules" by which the individual processes operate. 
 The formation of partial rules and the calculation of
transition rules are both applicable to hardware 
processes as well as to software processes, and
symmetry between processes is not required.
