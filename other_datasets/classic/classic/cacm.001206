The Self-Judgment Method of Curve Fitting
A computer-oriented method for processing and
communicating numerical data is described.  The 
Instrument Reliability Factors (IRF), which exactly
define the limits of reliability of each measured 
item of information, are used to compute the Maximum
Permitted Error (MPE) associated with each values 
of each ordinate.  The Self-Judgment Principle (SJP)
is used to discard wrong information and to compute 
mean values of the parameters and their MPE's in terms
of the IRF.  Data compatibility tests with any 
number of different equations can be made quickly. 
Otherwise intractable problems are easily solved, 
and the design of many experiments is greatly simplified.
 The computational and mathematical techniques 
used to reduce bias in the SJP are discussed.  Inadequacies
in the statistical and graphical methods 
of curve fitting are noted.
