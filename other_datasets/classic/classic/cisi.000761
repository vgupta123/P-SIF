Minimum Vocabularies in Information Indexing
   Words have no precision, though in information storage and retrieval we are
required to act as if they did.. We have, therefore, to impose certain 
arbitrary conditions to reduce the element of personal interpretation..
'Meaning' must be remove from the indexing stage to that of vocabulary 
construction.. Vocabularies can be reduced to a minimum, first to a core of 
terms used in specialist science, and, following Russel, ultimately to
undefined terms symbolic of sense experience.. 'Basic English' has shown 
similar minimizing to be feasible for a natural language.. The success of
Batten cards shown that the principle could be equally applicable to specialist 
indexing vocabularies..
