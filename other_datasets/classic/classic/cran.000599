aerodynamic forces, moments and stability derivatives
for slender bodies of general cross section .
  the problem of determining the total
forces, moments, and stability
derivatives for a slender body performing
slow maneuvers in a compressible
fluid is treated within the assumptions
of slender-body theory .  general
expressions for the total forces (except
drag) and moments are developed
in terms of the geometry and motions of
the airplane, and formulas for
the stability derivatives are derived in
terms of the mapping functions
of the cross sections .
  all components of the motion are
treated simultaneously and second
derivatives as well as first are obtained,
with respect to both the
motion components and their time rates of
change .  coupling of the
longitudinal and lateral motions is thus
automatically included .  a number of
general relationships among the various
stability derivatives are found
which are independent of the configuration,
so that, at most, only 35
of a total of 325 first and second
derivatives need be calculated
directly .  calculations of stability
derivatives are carried out for two
triangular wings with camber and thickness,
one with a blunt trailing
edge, and for two wing-body combinations, one having a plane wing and
vertical fin .
  the influence on the stability
derivatives of the squared terms in
the pressure relation is demonstrated,
and the apparent mass concept as
applied to slender-body theory is discussed
at some length in the light
of the present analysis .  it is shown that
the stability derivatives can
be calculated by apparent mass although the
general expressions for the
total forces and moments involve additional terms .
