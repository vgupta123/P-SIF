The Potential Usefulness of Catalog Access Points Other
Than Author, Title, and  Subject
   Library patrons who wish to obtain a known document with which they
have had prior personal contact often cannot remember the standard author-
title-subject information about it with sufficient accuracy to be able
to look it up easily in present-day card catalogs.. However, they may
remember a surprising amount of such "nonstandard" information as the
color of the document's cover or its approximate length.. Could this
type of "nonstandard" information be profitably exploited in computerized
catalogs of the future?  Such facilities, if available, would surely be
used, for according to catalog usage surveys a majority of today's
library patrons seek known documents, and of these, a substantial
minority possess nonstandard information.. In this report, the results of
a memory experiment to test the memorability of various types of
nonstandard information are described and analyzed.. A ranking according
to relative memorability and potential retrieval usefulness of various
nonstandard book features is given.. It is estimated that if the average
patron's nonstandard information were exploited by appropriate retrieval
strategies, he would only have to search through roughly one five-hundredth
as many documents as in a random search.. This reduction factor is great
enough to make nonstandard information potentially useful in many
situations..
