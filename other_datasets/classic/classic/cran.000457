on laminar boundary-layer flow near a position of separation .
  singularities are considered in the solution of
the laminar boundary-layer
equations at a position of separation .  a singularity of
the type here considered occurred
in a careful numerical computation by hartree
for a linearly decreasing velocity
distribution outside the boundary layer ,. it may
occur generally .  whenever it does
occur, the boundary-layer equations cease to be
valid at and near separation on the
upstream side, and also downstream of separation .
the work suggests that
singularities may arise in the solution of non-linear
parabolic equations due to their
non-linearity .  the formulae found may help
computers of laminar boundary layers,
who desire more than a rough solution, to have
an end-point at which to aim .
