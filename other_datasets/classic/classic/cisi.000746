Subject Indexes and Automatic Document Retrieval
   Index entries from the subject indexes to CA can, in general, be converted
to 'normal' or title-like phrases by applying simple tests to the positions of
prepositions and conjunctions in the entries.. Other, more complex, entries can
be transformed after somewhat deeper analysis.. These manipulations are a 
necessary preliminary step to the use of the subject-index language in 
retrieval..A scheme is outlined for automatically compiling and editing subject 
indexes by transforming descriptive phrases with regular structure and 
vocabulary.. These transformations, based on the formal structure of language, 
are shown to be admirably suited to computer manipulation..
