A Technique for Software Module Specification with Examples
This paper presents an approach to writing
specifications for parts of software systems.  The 
main goal is to provide specifications sufficiently
precise and complete that other pieces of software 
can be written to interact with the piece specified without
additional information.  The secondary goal 
is to include in the specification no more information
than necessary to meet the first goal.  The technique 
is illustrated by means of a variety of examples from a tutorial system.
