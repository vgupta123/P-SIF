bending of a square plate with two adjacent edges free
and the others clamped or simply supported .
  the title problems were solved for the two cases ..  (1) uniform
transverse loading, (2) a concentrated force at the free corner .  a
function is chosen to exactly satisfy the biharmonic equation
while the boundary conditions are enforced at a number of points
plied at discrete points around the boundary for each of the four
problems and the resulting 35 simultaneous equations were solved
on an ibm 704 .  tables listing the values of deflection and
bending moments are presented .  this paper provides useful information
on the solution of these problems which are intractable by
analytical methods .
