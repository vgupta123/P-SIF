Selection of Equifrequent Word Fragments for Information Retrieval
   The design of programs to research large document data bases is discussed 
with regard to the use of compression coding combined with adoption of word 
fragments as the basic language elements.. An algorithm is described for 
determination of a set of almost equifrequent fragments.. Its efficiency is 
tested for a sample data base formed from the MARC tapes.. A certain threshold 
frequency acts as a parameter whose value determines the number of distinct 
fragments.. The selection algorithm is designed to give some preference to 
choice of the longest fragments and hence allow compact coding of the data base 
by concatenation of non-overlapping fragments..
