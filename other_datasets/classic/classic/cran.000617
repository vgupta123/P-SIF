determination of upper-atmosphere air density profile from satellite
observations .
the theory previously developed for the changes in the perigee distance
and semi-major axis of a satellite orbit due to air drag is extended to
enable the air-density profile/i.e.its relative variation with height/to
 be derived from the motion of the orbit's perigee . the solution is
first obtained in terms of the change in perigee distance and then in
terms of the change in the radius of the earth at the sub-perigee point
 the scale height in the 180 and 220 km altitude regions .
