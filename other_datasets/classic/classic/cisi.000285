Modernizing the University Library Structure
  Among the several kinds of change that appear to be in order in personnel
management in university libraries, some have been described, others have
not.  There has perhaps been a super-abundance of attention devoted, for
example, to the inadequate treatment of librarians within the university 
community as a whole, but little discussion has thus far appeared in print 
concerning their treatment within the library itself. This paper will attempt 
to define certain progressive changes that it is possible and probably 
desirable for the library to implement internally regardless of the university's
willingness to consider improving the librarian's lot in the larger community.
