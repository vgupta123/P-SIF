On Selecting A Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness
Part II. Implementation of the Philosophy
   It was argued in Part I (see JASIS, March-April 1973 p. 87) that the best
way to evaluate a retrieval system is, in principle at least, to elicit
subjective estimates of the system's utility to its users, quantified in
terms of the numbers of utilities (e.g. dollars) they would have been willing
to give up in exchange for the privilege of using the system; and a naive
methodology was outlined for evaluating retrieval systems on this basis..
But the impracticality of the naive evaluation procedure as it stands raises
the questions:	How can one decide which practical measure is likely to
yield results most closely resembling those of the naive methodology? And
how can one tell whether the resemblance is close enough to make applying
the measure worth while? In the present paper two kinds of solution to
these problems are taken up.. The first answers the questions in terms
of the reasonableness of the simplifying assumptions needed to get from
the naive measure to the proposed substitute.. The second answers it by
experimentation..
