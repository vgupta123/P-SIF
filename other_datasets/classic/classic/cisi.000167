Rationalization of Serial Holdings in Special Libraries
   This paper describes progress which has been made toward the development of
a procedural model intended as a code of good practice to enable special 
librarians to effect economies in their journal holdings by systematically 
planned use of the BLL..
   A theoretical model suggested by B. C. Brookes was tested on various sets of 
usage data from seven special libraries but the results proved to be unrealistic
in terms of immediate provision to the user.. A new experimental approach has 
now been developed based on the total use versus total cost of a journal 
collection..
