steady flow in the laminar boundary layer of a gas .
if the boundary-layer equations for a gas are
transformed by mises's transformation, as
was done by karman   tsion for the flow
along a flat plate of a gas with unit prandtl
number, the computation of solutions is
simplified, and use may be made of previously
computed solutions for an incompressible fluid .
for any value of the prandtl number, and
any variation of the viscosity with the temperature
t, after the method has been applied
to flow along a flat plate (a problem otherwise treated
by crocco), the flow near the forward
stagnation point of a cylinder is calculated with
dissipation neglected, both with the effect of
gravity on the flow neglected and with this effect
retained for vertical flow past a horizontal
cylinder .  the approximations involved by the neglect
of gravity are considered generally,
and the cross-drift is calculated when a horizontal
stream flows past a vertical surface .
when, and the boundary is heat-insulated,
it is shown that the boundary-layer
equations for a gas may be made identical, whatever be
the main stream, with the
boundary-layer equations for an incompressible fluid with a certain,
determinable, main stream .  the
method is also applied to free convection at a flat plate
variation with altitude of the state of the surrounding
fluid neglected) and to laminar flow in
plane wakes, but for plane jets the conditions,
previously imposed by howarth,
are also imposed here in order to obtain simple solutions .
