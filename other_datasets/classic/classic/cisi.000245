Case Studies in Systems Analysis in a University Library
  The marriage between the University of Michigan Library and
Community Systems Foundation seemed like a sensible step at the
time.  Too often, Library administration found it necessary to choose
between alternate courses of action without having adequate information.
In addition, overburdened department heads rarely found time
to alter their systems substantially to accommodate demands on the
library and their departments, let alone time to make these changes
in a systematic manner which considered the impact on other
departments and carefully weighed alternative solutions.  As a
consequence of this situation, the library administrators were
considering ways of providing staff assistance to themselves and
the department heads, so that alternate courses of action could
be designed and properly evaluated.
