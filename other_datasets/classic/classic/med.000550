control of idiopathic hypercalciuria
the paper discusses the causes of hypercalciuria and describes
15 cases of different origins all of which presented similarly
with renal stones.  the diagnosis of idiopathic hypercalciuria
was made by exclusion.  the effects of dietary restriction of
calcium, sodium bicarbonate, cortisone, sodium phosphate,
sodium phytate, and cellulose phosphate were demonstrated by
calcium and phosphorus balance techniques.  all were shown
to have some urinary-calcium-lowering effect.  finally, a
chlorothiazide derivative--namely, bendrofluazide--was also
demonstrated to have a hypocalciuric effect, and the mode of
action is discussed.
