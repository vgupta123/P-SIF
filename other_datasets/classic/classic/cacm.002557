On the Time Required for a Sequence of Matrix Products
This paper discusses the multiplication of conformable
sequences of row vectors, column vectors, 
and square matrices.  The minimum time required to evaluate
such products on ordinary serial computers 
as well as parallel computers is discussed.  Algorithms
are presented which properly parse such matrix 
sequences subject to the constraints of the machine organization.
