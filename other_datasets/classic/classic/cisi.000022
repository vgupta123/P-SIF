Education and Manpower for Librarians
  This paper is not an official policy statement
of the American Library Association nor
of the Office for Library Education.  It is
simply an exploration, an outline of possibilities
for consideration by the profession.  Its purpose is 
to generate discussion that will lead
eventually to a statement of Association policy
that the profession will support and make
effective.
  A basic assumption on which the statement
rests is this: that the library occupation is
much broader than that segment of it which is
the library profession, but that the professional
segment has responsibility for the definition
and supervision of the training and education
required by the complete range of activities
encompassed by the occupation.  Librarians
are not the only persons who work in
libraries, but librarians are the ones who are
concerned with the advancement and improvement
of the library profession.  It follows then
that it is the obligation of the professionals
to engage actively in the establishment and
maintenance of standards and norms governing
the preparation of people who work at
any level in libraries.  They should define and
guide the kinds of preparation most useful at
the pre-professional level and not
merely the education of those who will hold
positions at the level we now call "professional."
