Logical Flow Charts and Other New Techniques for the Administration
of Libraries and Information Centers
  The widespread introduction of electronic digital computer
systems for information processing has produced significant
advances in management theory and practice in recent years.
For example, two management devices, PERT and CPM, undeveloped 
and impractical before computers, have been basic to the success
of our outer space program.  It is perhaps overlate in library
development, but appropriate in this memorial to Miss Esther J.
Piercy, to explore the application of new management knowledge
and practice to the administration of libraries and information
centers, and to sketch some directions in which research could be
undertaken to benefit the management of information.
