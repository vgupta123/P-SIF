critical combinations of shear and transverse direct
stress for an infinitely long flat plate with
edges elastically restrained against rotation .
  an exact solution and a closely concurring approximate
energy solution are given for the buckling of an infinitely long
flat plate under combined shear and transverse direct stress
with edges elastically restrained against rotation .  it was found
that an appreciable fraction of the critical stress in pure shear
may be applied to the plate without any reduction in the
transverse compressive stress necessary to produce buckling .  an
interaction formula in general use was shown to be decidedly
conservative for the range in which it is supposed to apply .
