hyperaldosteronism, hyperplasia of the
juxtaglomerular complex, normal
blood pressure, and dwarfism:
report of a case
a patient with the syndrome of hyperal-
dosteronism, hyperplasia of the juxtaglo-
merular complex, dwarfism, and normal
blood pressure is reported in detail.  in this
patient, the aldosterone secretion rate in-
creased significantly and the serum potas-
sium rose slightly with sodium depriva-
tion.  with a low-sodium diet urinary sodi-
um fell to zero.  spironolactone with a low-
sodium diet raised serum potassium to nor-
mal.  infusion of albumin, however, resul-
ted in a rapid increase in serum potassium
and a fall in aldosterone secretion rate.  the
unique features in this patient are the re-
sponse to albumin and the lowering of uri-
nary sodium to zero in response to a low-
sodium intake.  in all other essentials, the
case resembles the two previously reported
cases.  treatment by subtotal adrenalecto-
my was not curative.
