  author shows that the differential equations defining the
minimum drag body shapes for free molecule flow that were developed
and numerically integrated by w. j. carter (amr 11 (1958), rev.
realized, however, that numerical or analytical integration of the
second-order differential equation is unnecessary since, for the
flow conditions considered, the first integral to the euler equation
can be written prior to the substitution of the expression defining
the pressure coefficient .
