Methods for Analyzing Data from Computer Simulation Experiments
This paper addresses itself to the problem of
analyzing data generated by computer simulations 
of economic systems.  We first turn to a hypothetical firm,
whose operation is represented by  single-channel, 
multistation queueing model.  The firm seeks to maximize
total expected profit for the coming period 
by selecting one of five operating plans, where each
plan incorporates a certain marketing strategy, 
an allocation of productive inputs, and a total cost.
 The results of the simulated activity under each 
plan are subjected to an F-test, two multiple comparison
methods, and a multiple ranking method.  We 
illustrate, compare, and evaluate these techniques.
 The paper adopts the position that the particular 
technique of analysis (possibly not any one of the above)
chosen by the experimenter should be an expression 
of his experimental objective: The F-test tests the homogeneity
of the plans; multiple comparison methods 
quantify their differences; and multiple ranking methods
directly identify the one best plan or best 
plans.
