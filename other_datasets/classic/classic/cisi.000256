The Civic Culture
  We are concerned in this book with a number of classic themes
of political science: with what the Greeks called civic virtue and its
consequences for the effectiveness and stability of the democratic
polity; and with the kind of community life, social organization, and
upbringing of children that fosters civic virtue.  In using survey
research to study these classic themes, we are also following the
traditional practice of relying on the most precise methods available to
us for the investigation of these problems.  Perhaps Tocqueville and
Bryce, were they living today, would have relied somewhat on
the cross-section survey in their comparative studies of democratic
attitudes.
