DIALOG: A Conversational Programming System with a Graphical Orientation
DIALOG is an algebraic language for online
use with a graphical input-output console device. 
 It is a computational aid for the casual user, which
provides basic facilities for graphical and numeric 
input and display, online and off line program preparation
and storage, and hard copy presentation of 
results.  Use of the system requires a minimum of experience
or instruction, since the growth of an overlaying 
system control language has been prevented, and there
are no processor-oriented statements, like variable 
type or dimension declarations.  Moreover, in the online
situation the processor interacts with the graphical 
keyboard on a character-by-character basis so as to
restrict the programmer's choice of input symbols 
to those which are syntactically correct. DIALOG has been
in daily operation at the IIT Research Institute 
since February, 1966.
