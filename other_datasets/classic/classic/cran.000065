convection of a pattern of vorticity through a shock
wave .
  an arbitrary weak spatial distribution of vorticity can be
represented in terms of plane sinusoidal shear waves of all orientations and
wave lengths (fourier integral) .  the analysis treats the passage of a
single representative weak shear wave through a plane shock and shows
refraction and modification of the shear wave with simultaneous
generation of an acoustically intense sound
wave .  applications to turbulence
and to noise in supersonic wind tunnels are indicated .
