c-acetyl bovine growth hormone
a procedure is described for labeling bovine growth hormone
and human albumin with c-acetylation.  the labeled molecule
was biologically and antigenically similar to unlabeled bovine
growth hormone.  following administration of the labeled
hormone to animals, the label appeared to remain attached to
the growth hormone molecule for at least 4 hours.  administra-
tion of the labeled hormone promoted growth in hypophysec-
tomized rats and increased the free fatty acid concentration
in rabbit serum to a degree comparable with that seen following
administration of unlabeled growth hormone.  rabbit anti-
bovine growth hormone serum neutralized the rat growth
response to the acetylated hormone, and immunized rabbits
had altered isotope dilution and no increase in serum free fatty
acids after intravenous injection of the labeled hormone.
