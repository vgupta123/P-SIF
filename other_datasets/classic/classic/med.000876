treatment of short stature in children and adolescents
with human pituitary growth hormone (raben).  experience
with thirty-five cases.
human pituitary growth hormone (raben) was
evaluated by longitudinal study of
growth as a therapeutic agent in the treatment
of short stature.  clinically significant
increases in growth rate were achieved in 11
of 13 hypopituitary patients.  no significant
improvement in linear growth rate was
noted with a dose of 2 mg 3 times
weekly in children whose short stature was due
to other conditions.  no adverse reactions
were noted; thyroidal, adrenal or gonadal
activation was not observed.  growth
was stimulated, probably without an undue increase
in bone age, though this point
demands continued scrutiny.  owing to the limited
supply of this material it is recommended
that it be used only in cases of documented
growth failure, and a protocol
for evaluation of therapeutic response is discussed.
though not a panacea for treatment
of short stature, human growth hormone
fulfils a unique and invaluable role
in replacement therapy for the hypopituitary dwarf.
