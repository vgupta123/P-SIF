NEATER2: A PL/I Source Statement Reformatter
NEATER2 accepts a PL/I source program and operates on it to produce
a reformatted version.  When in the LOGICAL mode, NEATER2 indicates
the logical structure of the source program in the indentation
pattern of its output.  Logic errors discovered through NEATER2
logical analysis are discovered much more economically than is possible
through compilation and trial runs.  A number of options are
available to give the user full control over the output format and
to maximize the utility of NEATER2 as an aid during the early
stages of development of a PL/I source deck.  One option, USAGE, causes
NEATER2 to insert into each logical unit of coding a statement
which will case the number of times each one is executed to be recorded
during execution.  This feature is expected to provide a
major aid in optimization of PL/I programs.
