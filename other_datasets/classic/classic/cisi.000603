The Efficiency of MEDLARS Titles for Retrieval
   Previous research has indicated that the titles rather than index terms 
would, in the standard MEDLARS system, gave lower Recall but higher Precision..
A title searching technique is described which allows the number of references
retrieved to be fixed before a search commences.. With this technique the
greater applicability of title-terms offsets their relative paucity.. The
title-searching technique is tested using queries put to MEDLARS.. These 
queries were not specially solicited for the test.. Title searching is compared
with the standard MEDLARS index term search and with an index term search with 
fixed output size.. For equal output sizes, Title searching retrieves 4 
relevant references for every 5 retrieved by index term searching.. Thus the 
relative retrieval efficiency of Title and Index terms is so close that the 
choice of one method or the other must be primarily on economic grounds..
