calculated subsonic span loads and resulting stability derivatives of
unswept and 45degree sweptback tail surfaces in sideslip and steady roll .
subsonic span loads and the resulting stability derivatives have been
calculated for a systematic series of vertical- and horizontal-tail
combinations in sideslip and in steady roll in order to provide
information embracing a wide range of probable tail configurations . all
 calculations were made by application of the discrete-horseshoe-vortex
method to the problem of estimating loads on intersecting surfaces . the
 investigation covered variations in vertical-tail aspect ratio, the
ratio of horizontal-tail aspect ratio to vertical-tail aspect ratio, the
 effects of horizontal-tail dihedral angle /for the sideslip case/, and
the effects of vertical position of the horizontal tail for surfaces
having their quarter-chord lines swept back 0degrees and 45degrees . the
 results of the investigation are presented in charts from which the
span loads for the various conditions can be obtained . the resulting
stability derivatives are presented as vertical- and horizontal-tail
contributions as well as total-tail-assembly derivatives .
the results of this investigation, which was made for a wider range of
geometric variables than previous studies, showed trends which were in
general agreement with the results of previous investigations . also
presented in this paper and used in the computations is an extensive
table of values of sidewash due to a rectangular vortex .
