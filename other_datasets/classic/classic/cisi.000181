Medical School Library Statistics
  At the June 1962 Convention of the Medical Library Association in
Chicago, Illinois, Mr. Stanley Truelson, now Librarian of the University of
Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry, circulated a petition
requesting the collection and publication of medical school library
statistics.  Forty-eight medical school head librarians signed the
petition indicating their approval, and a committee for this purpose was formed 
by Dr. Vilma Proctor, Chairman of the Medical School Libraries Group of
the Medical Library Association.
  This committee, composed of Mr. Truelson, Dr.Proctor, and myself,
studied the questionnaires already in use, such as that of the U.S. Office
of Education.  These were rejected as not meeting the needs of our
specialized group of libraries.  As a guide for selecting the terminology
in the questionnaire, we used the American Library Association's Definitions
for Library Statistics; a Preliminary Draft (Chicago, 1961).
  After several drafts, a sample questionnaire was approved by the
committee and distributed to all the medical school libraries in the United
States and Canada.  The Canadian medical school libraries were included
as a result of communications with Miss Doreen Fraser, Librarian of the
Bio-Medical Library of the University of British Columbia and Dr. J.
Wendell McLeod of the Association of Canadian Medical Colleges.
