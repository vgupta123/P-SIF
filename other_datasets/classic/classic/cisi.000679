Conversion of Wiswesser Notation to a Connectivity Matrix for Organic Compounds
  A computer program is described which generates a connectivity matrix using
as input an unmodified Wiswesser notation.  This program records the topology
of a molecule as a statement of the atoms and their connectivity.  One symbol
is used to represent each atom and this symbol is descriptive of the atom and
its bonds.  The network of a complex molecule is recorded as a series of 
interruptions in an assumed linear path.  The application of this matrix to
information handling of chemical structures is described in a subsequent paper.
