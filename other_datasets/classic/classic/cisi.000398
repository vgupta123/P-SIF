Informal Channels of Communication In the Behavioral Sciences:
Their Relevance In the Structuring of Formal or Bibliographic
Communication
    What are the needs being served by informal communication?
What can be done about giving informal communication, without
destroying its function for the active researcher, certain of
the advantages of formal communication, such as, general
accessibility, permanence, etc.?  How can formal channels be
manipulated to take on the characteristics of informal
communication?  To cast light on these questions the present
paper examines the role of informal and formal channels within
the overall system of scientific dissemination in psychology,
considers the special advantages of informal communication,
and outlines certain relations between informal and formal
channels.  In a final section of the paper, two experiments
in scientific communication are described; one experiment being
built about an innovation that attempts to "informalize" formal
channels while the other is built about another innovation that,
in general, attempts to "formalize" an informal channel.
