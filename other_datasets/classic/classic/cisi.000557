Introduction to Systems Philosophy
    The general systems theory, pioneered by von Bertalanffy,
Kenneth Boulding, Anatol Rapoport and their collaborators, gives us a
theoretical instrument for assuring the mutual relevance of scientific
information and philosophic meaning.  Extended into a general systems
philosophy, this instrument can polarize the contemporary theoretical scene
as a magnet polarizes a field of charged particles: by ordering the formerly
random segments into a meaningful pattern.  If made good use of, this
instrument could channel to us a stream of informed as well as sophisticated
answers through the cross-fertilization of contemporary science and
philosophy.
    This, then is my credo; the conviction which led to the formulation of the
present Introduction to "systems philosophy" over a period of three years
of research in alternating states of euphoria and dejection.
