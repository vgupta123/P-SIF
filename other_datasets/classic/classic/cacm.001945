The Role of Programming in a Ph.D. Computer Science Program
In this general paper the role of programming
in advanced graduate training is discussed.  
Subject matter related to programming as well as programming
per se is considered.  The  importance and 
application of formalism are considered and also the
need for good empirical experimentation.  A brief 
outline for a sequence of courses is included, and subject
headings that have been obtained from an extensive 
bibliography are given.  A bibliography of programming references is included.
