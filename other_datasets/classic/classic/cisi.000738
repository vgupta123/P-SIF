Substructure Searching of Computer-Readable Chemical Abstracts
Service Ninth Collective Index Nomenclature Files
  The increasing availability of computer-readable files of chemical  
nomenclature and of programs for text searching has led to the development
of methods for performing substructure searches in which CA nomenclature
terms are used as search terms.  Substructure searches on CA Index
nomenclature can often result in very high recall relative to topological
searches, as is shown by experimental results achieved on a variety of
searches.  Many data bases which contain CA Index nomenclature also contain
nonsubstance data.  Thus, searching of substance and nonsubstance data
can often be done within a single search of a file with both high recall
and relevancy.  Profile construction aids prepared by CAS make it possible
for persons without sophisticated nomenclature backgrounds to construct
nomenclature profiles for many questions.
