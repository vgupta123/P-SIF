Legal Restrictions on Exploitation of the Patent Monopoly:
An Economic Analysis
  The patent laws confer on a patentee power to exclude all others
from making, using or selling his invention.  In furtherance of a
constitutionally recognized goal - "To promote the Progress of
Science and the useful Arts" - Congress has thus adopted a 
constitutionally authorized means - "securing...to Inventors
the exclusive Right to their respective...Discoveries."  The
constitutional clause is remarkable in several respects.  Its
recognition of the possibility that invention might require
encouragement implies not only that technological innovation is
desirable but also that, but for legal subsidization, the quantity
of innovation forthcoming would or might be less than optimum.
This recognition, coming on the morn of an era during which the
tendency of a free market to achieve optimality in all activities
was greatly and religiously overestimated, prompts brief inquiry
into the soundness of the supposition.
