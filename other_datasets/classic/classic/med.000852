renal and adrenal relationships
in compensatory hyperplasia
the compensatory renal hyperplasia that
normally follows unilateral nephrectomy
is abolished by bilateral adrenalectomy if
rats are maintained on fresh drinking
water, but is restored when saline drinking
water is provided or if such animals are
injected with doca.  the adrenals are also
important for the increased proliferation
caused by unilateral hydronephrosis.  these
experiments suggest that the role of the
adrenal cortex in renal hyperplasia may be to
secrete mineralocorticoids, which
promote the retention of sodium and thereby
stimulate cell division in the kidneys.
