a collection of longitudinal stability derivatives
of wings at supersonic speeds .
  a collection has been made of
theoretical data, for wings alone, on
those stability derivatives that govern
the short-period oscillation of
aircraft travelling at supersonic speeds .
all the derivatives available
have been obtained by means of the linear
theory, and so the information
given is subject to the usual limitations .
the information has been
presented in what is hoped is the most
convenient form to show its extent,
and to expose the parts of the field
where experimental investigation is
most needed .
