Main Entry for Serials
  The nature of serials is such that, in both the ALA Cataloging Rules for 
Author and Titles Entries and the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules (AACR),there
are special rules for choice of entry for serials that differ from the rules for 
monographs.  While the Statement of Principles Adopted at the International
Conference on Cataloging Principles (Paris Principles) leaves much room for 
interpretation and controversy regarding serials, it also provides for special 
rules for choice of entry.
