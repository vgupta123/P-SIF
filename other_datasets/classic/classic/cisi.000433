Improving Access to Library Resources
    The motivation for this investigation derived from a
series of visits to institutions which were deeply committed
to the design, development, and operation of non-traditional
automated information systems.  At the time of the visits,
the systems seemed to be working technically but, paradoxically,
they did not appear to have made a significant impact on the
respective user communities.  Although few people associated
with the systems openly expressed concern, there were non-verbal
indicators which suggested that some people were becoming nervous.
Since all of the systems represented high expenditures of time
and money, a feeling of uneasiness seemed quite appropriate.
