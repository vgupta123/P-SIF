the design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web
plates subjected to shear .
  the correct design of intermediate vertical stiffeners on web plates
subjected to shear becomes very important when
the web plates are designed
to operate at loads close to their buckling loads .
this paper presents details
of an extensive series of tests conducted on
stiffened web plates subjected to
shear .  from the analysis of the results obtained
from these tests, new empirical
relationships between the flexural rigidity and
spacing of the intermediate
stiffeners and the buckling stress of the stiffened
web plate have been obtained .
  one interesting and important feature of
these new relationships is that
they define more clearly than hitherto the difference
in the behaviour of
single-and double-sided stiffeners .
