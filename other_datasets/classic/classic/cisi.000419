A Statistical Approach to Mechanized Encoding and Searching of Literary 
Information
   Written communication of ideas is carried out on the basis of statistical 
probability in that a writer chooses that level of subject specificity and that
combination of words which he feels will convey the most meaning.. Since this
process varies among individuals and since similar ideas are therefore relayed
of different levels of specificity and by means of different words, the problem
of literature searching by machines still present major difficulties.. A 
statistical approach  to this problem will be outlined and the various steps
of a system based on this approach will be described.. Steps include the 
statistical analysis of a collection of document in a field of interest, the 
establishment of a set of "notions" and the vocabulary by which they are
expressed, the compilation of a thesaurus-type dictionary and index, the
automatic encoding of documents by machine with the aid of such a dictionary,
the encoding of topological notations (such as branches structures), the 
recording of the coded information, the establishment of a searching pattern 
for finding pertinent information, and the programming of appropriate machines
to carry out a search..
