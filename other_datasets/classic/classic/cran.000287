  the weissinger method for determining additional span
loading for incompressible flow is used to find the damping in
roll, the lateral center of pressure of the rolling load, and the
span loading coefficients caused by rolling for wing plan forms
of various aspect ratios, taper ratios, and sweep angles .  in
addition, the applicability of the method to the determination
of certain other aerodynamic derivatives is investigated, and
corrections for the first-order effects of compressibility are
indicated .
  the agreement obtained between experimentally and
theoretically determined values for the aerodynamic coefficients
indicates that the method of weissinger is well suited to the
calculation of the additional span loading caused by rolling
and for the calculation of such resulting aerodynamic
derivatives of wings as do not involve considerations of tip suction .
