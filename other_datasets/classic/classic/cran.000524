stagnation point heat transfer in partially ionized
air .
  comparison of heat-transfer rates, obtained by using transport
properties recently reported by peng and pindroh, with rates based
on hansen's thermodynamic and transport properties .  it is shown
that the heat-transfer rates based on the peng and pindroh data
are 20 to 30 lower for the velocity range of 25,000 to 40,000
ft sec .
