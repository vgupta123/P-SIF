A Generalized Methodology for Library Systems Analysis
  This article is directed toward the service in systems work.  Its purpose is 
to generalize at a very elementary level a methodology or approach which can be
used in conducting a systems study. Systems work is discussed here as a point
of view; a logical, coherent, from the top down, preface to decision-making
and resource allocation which utilizes a very powerful body of sophisticated
techniques.  The approach and techniques reviewed in this paper, however,
will be those on the most elementary  level.  No attempt will be made to
discuss the techniques of queueing, inventory management, linear programming,
simulation, marginal analysis, game theory, statistical inference, or any of
the other highly sophisticated techniques available to the operations 
research systems analysis (OR/SA) analyst. When the systems approach is clearly
understood and properly used, it becomes a potent weapon in the arsenal
of the administrator.  Rather than a review of the tools themselves, a
delineation of this systems methodology and point of view will be considered in 
this article.  The methodology discussed here embraces a number of standard 
techniques used by the systems engineer, time and motion analyst, operations 
researcher, and occasionally, even the librarian.
