on the numerical solution of the blasius problem with three-point
boundary conditions .
relates to a technique for approximate determination of the initial
parameters . the technique is an application of the asymptotic
integration method introduced by meksyn and has been applied to the computation
 of the skin friction for shock-generated boundary-layer flow .
