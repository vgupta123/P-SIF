A Method of Estimating the In-House Use of the Periodical Collection in the
University of Minnesota Bio-Medical Library
   During two one-week periods in April 1972, information on periodical title 
and date was gathered from  periodicals collected from study and reshelving 
tables of the University of Minnesota Bio-Medical Library.
   It was determined that: (1) a few titles accounted for most of the total 
use; (2) the relationship between age and amount of use of a journal may be
described by the equation y = ke**(-bx); and (3) the last five years of 
publication accounted for 58% of the total use.
