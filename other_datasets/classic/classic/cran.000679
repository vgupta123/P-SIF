low speed tests on 45 sweptback wings .
  this report contains the results
of pressure measurements on three
and aspect ratio 5, over an
incidence range up to 10 .  chordwise
and spanwise lift distributions
are given, mostly near the centre
where, on two of the wings,
modifications had been made to the section
shape .  it was found that altering
the thickness distribution in the
centre did not affect the loading but
that approximately straight isobars
could be obtained at values of
below about 0.1 .  by the incorporation
of twist and camber in the central
part the distortion of the lift
distribution in the centre could be
avoided at one particular incidence,
and thus the same chordwise
distribution obtained over most of the span .
  twist and camber alone do not improve
the isobar pattern and
therefore a thickness modification would be
needed to give the desired
lift distribution and isobar pattern at one
particular incidence .
  the results of experimental investigations
of the boundary layer
and of the effect of aspect ratio will be given
in a later report .
