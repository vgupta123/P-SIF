Dewey Decimal Classification
  The schedules of Edition 18, like those of 17, are based on the
principle of subject integrity.  Both the subject matter and the notation are
hierarchical, so that what is true of a given whole is true of all its parts.
The schedules are developed according to logical principles, so that the
classifier is guided to make correct decisions.  The terminology of the
classification scheme reflects the terminology used by the literature
being classified.
  For ease of use, this edition includes many more example notes, more detailed
and precise instructions, and freer use of layman's terminology than did its
immediate predecessor.
  Since this edition is intended for use as a shelf-arrangement system for
general libraries of all sizes, its fulness is based upon the number of titles
that large libraries may be expected to acquire in various fields.  Since
it is also intended for use in classified catalogs and bibliographies (for
which the Dewey Decimal Classification is increasingly in demand in many
countries), it contains an increased number of provisions for number building.
