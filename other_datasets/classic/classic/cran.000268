the influence of transverse magnetic fields on
the laminar free-convection flow of liquid
metals over a vertical flat plate and between
vertical parallel plates is examined for
specific wall temperature variations and
prandtl numbers .  the extent of influence on
the flow and temperature fields is determined
by the magnitude of a nondimensional
influence parameter which is the ratio of the
magnetic force to the buoyant force .  in
general, increasing the magnetic field strength
decreases the magnitude of the velocity, wall
shear, and surfaces heat transfer and
increases the temperature throughout the fluid .
analytical results demonstrate that magnetic
fields of practical strengths exert
considerable influence on liquid metal free-convection flow fields .
