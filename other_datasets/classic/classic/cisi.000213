The Role of the Medical Librarian in SDI Systems
   Many ongoing selective dissemination systems designers assume that the 
librarian can be omitted from active participation in execution of the master
plan.. ISI's four years of experience with ASCA service have shown that 
librarians must be an integral part of the system and engage in a active 
dialogue between users and the machine.. Specific examples of how 
librarians can best serve the information needs of scientists using SDI systems
are examined.. It is the basic contention of this paper that the librarian
should serve as an intermediary between users and the numerous new information
media.. In this manner the librarian can filter and translate the requirements
of individual scientists to conform with the inherent limitations of all
machine systems while exploiting their capabilities to the fullest..
