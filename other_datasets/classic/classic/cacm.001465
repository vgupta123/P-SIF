Program Translation Viewed as a General Data Processing Problem
Efficiency dictates that the overall effectiveness
of a compiler be increased by all means 
available.  For a compiler to have a substantial useful
life it needs a clear logical structure, reliability 
and sound data processing techniques.  A compiler must
be based on fixed conventions to preserve efficiency 
and reliability; empty options and default conventions
violate this dictum.  Use of structure to associate 
various parts of a program and economy of
features promote clarity and reliability.
