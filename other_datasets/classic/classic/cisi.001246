Reader Instruction in Colleges and Universities
DEFINITION:  What is 'reader instruction'?  Another currently
used term is 'library instruction', which puts the emphasis on 
the library rather than the reader, and which also suggests to
some that library instruction concerns the training of librarians.
For the purpose of this introductory handbook 'reader instruction'
is taken to mean instruction given to readers to help them make 
the best use of a library, particularly an academic library of
some size and complexity.
