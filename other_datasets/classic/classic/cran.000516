free-flight measurements of the dynamic longitudinal
stability characteristics of a wind tunnel interference
model (m=0 .92 to 1. 35) .
  the dynamic longitudinal-stability characteristics of a standard
wind tunnel interference model have been investigated in free flight
over a mach number range of 0.92 to 1.35 .
  measurements of lift-curve slope and manoeuvre margin were
obtained, and are compared with results from transonic-tunnel tests
under low blockage conditions .
  the analysis was extended to obtain damping derivatives to allow
comparison to be made with possible future dynamic tests in wind tunnels
on the standard shape .
