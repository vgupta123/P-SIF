An Optimal Insertion Algorithm for One-Sided
Height-Balanced BInary Search Trees
An algorithm for inserting an element into a one-sided height-balanced
(OSHB) binary search tree is presented.  The algorithm operates in time 
O(log n), where n is the number of nodes in
the tree.  This represents an improvement over the best previous
ly known insertion algorithms of Hirschberg and Kosaraju, which require
time O(log 2n).  Moreover, the O(log n) complexity is optimal. Earlier 
results have shown that deletion in such a structure can
also be performed in O(log n) time.  Thus the result of this paper
gives a negative answer to the question of whether such trees should
be the first examples of their kind, where deletion has a smaller time 
complexity than insertion.  Furthermore, it can now be concluded
that insertion, deletion, and retrieval in OSHB trees can
be performed in the same time as the corresponding operations for
the more general AVL trees, to within a constant factor.  However,
the insertion and deletion algorithms for OSHB trees appear much
more complicated than the corresponding algorithms for AVL trees.
