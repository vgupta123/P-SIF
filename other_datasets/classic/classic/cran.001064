propeller slipstream effects as determined from wing
pressure distribution on a large-scale six-propeller
vtol model at static thrust .
  during static-thrust tests of a
large-scale general research model having a
tilting wing and double-slotted flaps,
static-pressure measurements were made on
a wing segment behind one propeller to
survey the effects of the slipstream .  for
the conditions of highest slipstream energy,
the hovering end point of aerodynamic
parameters for aircraft having vertical and
short take-off and landing capability
the tilt-wing configuration (zero
flap deflection) was a 6 spanwise variation
in effective angle of attack in a
span of slightly less than 1 propeller diameter .
effective changes in camber
on the tilt-wing configuration as a result of
slipstream rotation, the radial
velocity gradient, and the resultant spanwise
flow were negative and had a maximum
magnitude of less than 2-percent chord .  for
the deflected-slipstream
configuration (double-slotted flaps deflected), effects
important to the hovering
performance were found, including a 40-percent spanwise
variation in effective thrust
recovery and a 20 spanwise variation in effective
thrust turning .
