  the nonlinear boundary value problem, where
and m are constants, is solved formally by first
introducing power series in t for the unknown temperature
and flux at the surface and then determining the coefficients
in those series .  in this manner the temperature function is
determined as a series of repeated integrals of error
functions .  the convergence is rapid only for small values of t .
the special cases and generalizations of
the condition at the surface for which the same method
applies, are noted .  surface temperatures are also found by
methods of difference equations, where t is not limited to
small values .  graphs of these temperatures corresponding
to various laws of heat transfer at the surface are shown .
