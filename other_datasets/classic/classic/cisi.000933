The Library Press
  The deadliest disease afflicting the library press is proliferation.  The
kindest and most conservative estimate I am able to bring myself to make is
that there are at least three times as many library periodicals in this country
as we can afford or are necessary. Perhaps the most constructive single thing
that could be accomplished would be to persuade at least one in three
publishers of a library periodical to cease publication.
  One might reasonably expect that librarians, who have done so much
public wailing about the publication explosion, would be among the chief
advocates and practitioners of birth control in the world of print.  Instead
we find them cavorting as uninhibitedly in the king-size bed of printed 
procreation as do the denizens of the Sodom and Gomorrah of science and 
technology. Just about every library of any consequence (and some of little
consequence) and, almost without exception, every group or organization
within the loose boundaries of our  profession, decides, virtually at the
moment of its birth, that it cannot survive without a publication of its
own - a newsletter, a journal, some regular calling card to announce its 
presence to the world at large.
