Current Awareness Bibliographies in the State Information System
   Notes that at present the current awareness bibliography of Soviet
publications (which is provided, in some form or other almost in all of the 
areas of knowledge, production, or culture) fails to ensure complete enough
information even with respect to directly related literature.  A set of
measures are suggested, aimed at a cardinal improvement of the listings in the
state bibliography system..
