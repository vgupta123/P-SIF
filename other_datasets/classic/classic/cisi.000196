Basic Journal List for Small Hospital Libraries
   This Basic Journal List of forty-eight journal titles is intended as a 
selection guide for the librarian of the small hospitals.. It is based on a
survey of physicians in Virginia who were asked to review journal titles
contained in the 1967 edition of a list compiled by Mr. Alfred N. Brandon..
The List is designed for the library in a hospital of from 100 to 300 beds and
for the active clinician..
