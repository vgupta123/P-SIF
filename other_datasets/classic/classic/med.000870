a comparison of human placental lactogen (hpl) and human growth hormone
(hgh) in hypopituitary patients.
   the conclusions based on the studies reported are
that placental lactogen (hpl) at a dose level of 200 mg./
day did not induce a positive nitrogen balance in two hypopituitary
subjects.  in addition, lactogen does not augment
the nitrogen retaining effect of growth hormone
when given in a dose of 200 mg./day.
