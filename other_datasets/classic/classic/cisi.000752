On the Inverse Relationship of Recall and Precision
  It is now ten years since some slight experimental evidence was presented
which appeared to support the hypothesis that there was an inverse
relationship between recall and precision. The idea of this was certainly not
new; Fairthorne had more than implied it in his discussions on OBNA and
ABNO systems, i.e. Only-But-Not-All (high precision) and All-But-Not-
Only (high recall).  However, it was one of the propositions arising from
Cranfield I which met with strong opposition and was quite rightly attacked.
In reply to the critical review by Swanson, I had to agree that the
simple hypothesis required modification.  By the following year test results
coming from the experiments by Salton and from Cranfield II made
further modification necessary, and the hypothesis was finally put forward
to read as follows: 'Within a single system, assuming that a sequence of
subsearches for a particular question is made in the logical order of expected
decreasing precision, and the requirements are those stated in the question,
there is an inverse relationship between recall and precision, if the results
of a number of different searches are averaged.  This, it will be noted, has
four qualifications to the basic statement.
