periodic temperature distributions in a two-layer composite
slab .
an investigation to determine the feasibility of using an
insulating thermal barrier to protect exposed solid
propellant motors from atmospheric or environmental temperature
variations has recently been completed .  in one portion of this
study, a solution was developed for the periodic temperature
distribution in a two-layer composite slab .  one exposed surface of
this composite slab was adiabatic, and the other exposed surface
was subjected to a sinusoidal temperature variation .  the
technique used in the analysis was similar to that of grober .  in this
note, pertinent features of the development of the solution are
given .
