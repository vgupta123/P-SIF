Pay Libraries & User Charges
  The battle lines are being drawn for a great debate
over the emotionally and politically charged issue of how library
and information services are to be funded in the coming decades.
Most librarians will be on the side of "conservatism" and "democracy,"
favoring the continuation of traditional modes of tax-supported public
library service with information freely available to all
as a matter of right.  Information industry people, publishers,
government officials, engineers, and even, perhaps, authors will be
on the side of "progress" and "profits," advocating a new concept of
for-profit or pay libraries, user charges, and information as a salable 
commodity.
