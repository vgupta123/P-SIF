viscous flow past a quarter infinite plate .
  a study is made of the motion of an incompressible viscous
fluid past a quarter-infinite plate, whose leading edge is
perpendicular to and whose side edge is parallel to the undisturbed
direction of the stream .  it is assumed that the kinematic
viscosity is small .  the first approximation is taken to be the
undisturbed motion, and successive approximations are obtained
by iferation .  the second approximation is the blasius shear
layer necessary to satisfy the boundary conditions on the plate .
in turn, this layer leads to a velocity component normal to the
plate which needs a potential solution, in which the velocities
are 0, to match with the conditions at infinity .  further,
the match at the edge of the blasius shear layer must be
completed to 0 by introducing a secondary shear layer .  the
regions near the leading and side edges are considered separately,.
in particular, the neighborhood of the side edge needs special
care, because the determination of the chief terms is complicated
by the presence of powers of log .  in particular it is shown
that the effect of the edge is to change the skin-friction coefficient
by a factor
