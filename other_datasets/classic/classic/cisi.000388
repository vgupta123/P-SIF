A Guide to the Construction and Use of Special Schemes
  The use of classification in libraries is traditional and its value is
appreciated.  For documentation and information retrieval in
general, other techniques such as alphabetical indexing and
machine selection are also available.  That classification is of
value in information retrieval as well as in book arrangement is,
however, made evident in two ways.  First, to achieve consistency
and subtlety in alphabetical indexing and machine selection
designers of such retrieval systems find the need to introduce
classificatory techniques.  Second, there is a continuing demand
for the construction of special classifications for detailed arrangement
and cataloguing of documents in restricted but intensively
cultivated fields of knowledge.
  It is to help meet these demands, particularly the second, that
this guide has been prepared.  The techniques of detailed depth
classification have been greatly developed during the past decade,
and instruments of much greater subtlety and efficiency than the
traditional 'tree-of-knowledge' schemes can now be designed.
These developments have been reported mainly as research papers
in a variety of library journals and are often made unnecessarily
difficult to follow by the use of unfamiliar terminology.
There is a need for a more simply written and more readily
available practical guide to the use of the newer techniques of
classification.
