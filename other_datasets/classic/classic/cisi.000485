A Clustering Experiment:
  First Step Towards a Computer-Generated Classification Scheme
   A document collection consisting of 240 articles on theoretical high energy
physics is analyzed by an empirical clustering procedure, in which 
bibliographic coupling, obtained by computer, is used to measure the 
relatedness of articles.. Meaningful groups of documents were produced.. The 
clustering process ia adapted to future use in the computer-generation of a 
classification scheme..
