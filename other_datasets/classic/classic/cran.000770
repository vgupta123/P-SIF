the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere .
  the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere fixed
in a uniform stream is calculated to the third order of
approximation by means of the janzen-rayleigh method .
the velocity and the pressure distributions over the
surface of the sphere are computed and the terms involving
the fourth power of the mach number, neglected in rayleigh's
calculation, are shown to be of considerable importance as
the local velocity of sound is approached on the sphere .
the critical mach number, that is, the value of the mach
number at which the maximum velocity of the fluid past the
sphere is just equal to the local velocity of sound, is
calculated for both the second and the third
approximations and is found to be, respectively, and .
