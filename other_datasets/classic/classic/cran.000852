stress and displacement analysis of simply supported
non- circular cylindrical shell under lateral pressure .
this paper presents an analysis of the deflections of and stresses in a
short noncircular cylindrical shell of uniform wall thickness whose
median-surface cross section is described analytically by a simple
expression corresponding to a family of doubly symmetric ovals .  the
cylinder is under a uniform lateral load and is simply supported at its
edges .  the small deflection analysis considered is based upon a series
solution of appropriate differential equations of shell theory which
leads ultimately to infinite sets of algebraic equations, truncated
forms of which are considered .  numerical values of the significant
stresses and displacements for points of the oval cylinder, which are 5
percent of the axial length and 2.5 percent of the circumferential
length apart, have been calculated for an oval cross section with a
major-minor axis ratio of 1.10 .
