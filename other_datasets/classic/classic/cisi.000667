A Mathematical Method for Analyzing the Growth of a Scientific Discipline
  The spread of ideas within a scientific community and the spread of infectious
disease are both special cases of a general communication process.  Thus a
general theory of epidemics can explain the growth of symbolic logic from 1847
to 1962.  An epidemic model predicts the rise and fall of particular research 
areas within symbolic logic.  A Markov chain model of individual movement 
between research areas indicates that once an individual leaves an area he is
not expected to return.
  KEY WORDS AND PHRASES:  epidemic model, epidemic process, theory of epidemics,
growth of literature, history of symbolic logic, epidemiology of symbolic logic,
epidemic curve, stochastic models, Markov chains.
