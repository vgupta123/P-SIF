numerical determination of indical lift of a two-dimensional sinking
airfoil at subsonic mach numbers from oscillatory lift coefficients with

the reciprocal equations for relating the incompressible circulatory
indicial lift to the lift due to harmonic oscillations have been
modified to include the noncirculatory lift associated with
apparent-mass effects . although the apparent-mass effects are impulsive in
nature in incompressible flow, the lift due to apparent-mass effects in
compressible flow is a time-dependent function . the corresponding
reciprocal equations for the total compressible lift are given . by use
of the reciprocal equations for compressible flow, the indicial lift and
 moment functions due to an airfoil's experiencing a sudden acquisition
of vertical velocity are determined numerically for mach number 0.7 .
lack of sufficient flutter coefficients prevents the calculation of
these functions at other mach numbers .
although the indicial lift and moment functions due to penetration of a
sharp-edge gust may be obtained from the oscillatory tab or aileron
coefficients by a similar analysis, sufficient coefficients are not
available at the present . however, an approximate method is shown for
determining a portion of this unsteady-lift function .
when a comparison is made of the indicial lift functions at mach numbers
appears to be less rapid for the compressible case than for the
incompressible case . consequently, the calculation of the gust load factor
at high subsonic mach numbers utilizing the two-dimensional
incompressible indicial lift functions and an over-all correction for
compressibility such as the prandtl-glauert factor might be conservative .
