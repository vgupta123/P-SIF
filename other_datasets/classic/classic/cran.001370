some remarks on the flat plate boundary layer .
  the authors discuss the solutions for the flow of a viscous
incompressible fluid near the leading edge of a semi-infinite
flat plate without pressure gradient .  the oseen
linearization is employed which approximates the equations of motion
and continuity by
where are the coordinate directions, the
corresponding velocity components and the uniform free stream
velocity which is parallel to the plate .  defining a
perturbation stream function by
the differential
equation to be solved is with boundary
conditions far from the plate and
when y=0 and .  the authors discuss the
problem by applying the two-dimensional fourier
transform and obtain an explicit solution for the velocity gradient
at the plate which is in disagreement
with the result of the blasius solution .  from this
the authors conclude that it would be more appropriate to
use a velocity other than in the linearization of the
equations of motion and suggest replacing by where .
this choice does not affect the solution far from
the plate but gives on the plate and in
comparison with blasius solution indicates that c=0.35 .
the solution of the modified oseen equation with this value
of c then seems acceptable as the approximate solution in
the region intermediate between the stokes flow and the
free stream .  on the basis of these considerations, the authors
suggest an iteration procedure for obtaining the exact
solution for the above problem as well as a solution for the plate
of finite length .
