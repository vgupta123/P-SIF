on local flat plate similarity in the hypersonic boundary
layer .
  a study is made of lees' /local flat-plate similarity/ rule for
the hypersonic laminar boundary layer .  it is shown that this
rule is exact under assumptions commonly invoked in the
inviscid theory of hypersonic flow .
  beginning from this theoretical basis, a modified local
flat-plate similarity scheme is derived, involving separate rules for
velocity and enthalpy profiles, and is compared with exact
similarity solutions and with the existing theory of hypersonic
leading-edge interaction .
