nonuniform shear flow past cylinders .
  a general method is described whereby
an approximation of any desired degree
of accuracy to the stream functions for
two types of variable shear flows past
finite cylinders can be obtained .  the two
shear distributions in the free stream can
be approximated to the linear shear
distribution and the shear present in an
unretarded incompressible boundary layer
respectively .  in every case the stagnation
streamline is displaced from the position
opposite the line of symmetry of the
cylinder, and general expressions are
obtained for this displacement .  the line of
symmetry may be in the direction of
or perpendicular to the direction of flow .
the two particular examples cited are
those of a general elliptic cylinder and
cylinders of the form where and being the polar
coordinates, and 2p the maximum width
of the cylinder .
