the cornell aeronautical laboratory is conducting a program of
theoretical and experimental research on low-speed aerodynamics as
applied to stol and vtol aircraft .  the objective of this program is to
re-examine certain aspects of classical aerodynamic information, in the
light of low-speed flight requirements, with the aim of seeking
aerodynamic processes which might be exploited to enhance law-speed
performance .
one aspect of propeller-driven aircraft which has recently received
increasing attention is the existence of strong gradients of
longitudinal velocity, or shear, in the propeller slipstream .  this
slipstream shear interacts with a wing surface and can alter the wing
characteristics .  in theoretical treatments of a wing interacting with
a propeller slipstream, the first important simplification is the
replacement of the slipstream with an ideal uniform
jet, free of all velocity
gradients .  the application of these theories requires that one equate
the actual slipstream to an effective uniform jet .  one method
employed is to assume the uniform jet has a momentum flux equal to the
average in the propeller slipstream .  these and similar procedures
are well founded on momentum considerations., however, the implicit
assumption is that the flow nonuniformity, the shear, does not influence
the wing characteristics .
