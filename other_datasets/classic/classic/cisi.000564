Automatic Document Classification
   Starting with a collection of 405 document abstracts dealing with
computers, the experiment in automatic document classification proceeds
to construct an
empirically based, mathematically derived classification system by use of a
factor analysis technique.. The documents are then classified into these 
derived categories by five subjects, and the resulting classification serves
as a criterion against which the automatic classification is to be evaluated..
Of the 90 documents in the validation group which contained two or more clue
words, and which therefore could be automatically classified, 44 documents, or
48.9 per cent, were placed into their correct categories by use of a computer 
formula.. These results are almost identical to the results obtained by Maron
in a previous experiment using the same data but with a different set of 
classification categories and a different computational formula.. The 
experimental evidence support the conclusion that automatic document 
classification is possible.. Additional experiments are described which when 
executed should improve the accuracy of the automatic classification 
technique..
