the bending of a sectorial plate .
  the problem of evaluating the bending moments,
existing in a uniformly loaded clamped plate having the form
of a sector of a ring, is one which arises in connection with
the stress analysis of reinforced piston heads and in other
design problems .  in this paper, expressions are derived
for the bending moments along the edges of such a plate .
similar problems, i.e., those of the clamped rectangular
plate under uniform pressure, under a central
concentrated load, and that of the simply supported sector of a
disk under uniform pressure, have been discussed by
previous authors .  the general approach used in the
foregoing problems is adopted in the present case ,. a
considerable reduction in the computational work is achieved,
however, by the use of an integral-equation method of
solving the boundary-condition equations .  numerical
results are obtained for plates of various dimensions, and
the edge moment distributions are plotted for these cases .
curves are also plotted which indicate the relationship
existing between the maximum bending moments derived
for sectorial plates and those previously obtained for
clamped rectangular plates of similar size .
