Automation of Etching-Pattern Layout
HELP (Heuristic Etching-Pattern Layout Program)
is an application program developed to computerize 
the tedious and error-prone although vitally important
wiring design of printed circuit boards.  HELP 
helps automate a design stage one step closer to production
than logical design.  It can be used to design 
wiring patterns of two-layer circuit boards on which
ICs in dual-in-line packages as well as discrete 
components such as transistors and resistors have been
placed.  HELP employs two methods of wiring.  
One is the heuristic method, which simulates human
approaches to wiring design, and the other is the 
theoretically interesting but time-consuming method of
maze-running, based on the Lee's algorithm.  HELP 
performs more than 90 percent of required wiring by
the heuristic path with respect to a performance 
function for each point-to-point, and point-to-line
connection.  It can bring the number of successful 
wiring connections very close to 100 percent.
