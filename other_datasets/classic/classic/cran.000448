induction drag on a large negatively charged satellite
moving in a magnetic-field-free ionosphere .
  an induction drag, experienced by a
charged satellite during its traversal of the
ionosphere, has been theoretically postulated by
several authors .  previous 'exact' treatments
of the problem are inapplicable to large systems, and
the semiempirical approach of jastrow
and pearse may yield somewhat questionable results .
the present description initially
considers the satellite as a completely permeable spherical
shell of charge, thus avoiding the
difficult boundary conditions introduced by the 'exact'
linearized treatment .  the effects of
permeability are then shown to be approximately removable
by means of an iterative process .  a
final result, apparently valid to within an order of
magnitude, is obtained for the drag force
arising solely from electrical effects .  its magnitude
is considerably less than that obtained by
jastrow and pearse .
