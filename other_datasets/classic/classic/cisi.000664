Semantic Road Maps for Literature Searchers
   The retrieval of documented information is one of today's most widespread
technical problems, affecting almost every large professional group, 
corporation, and government bureau.. Because document retrieval is in part an
information processing problem, much hope for a solution has vested in 
computers.. But large, fast, reliable ones have been around now for five year, 
and people have steadily realized that the over-all task of information 
retrieval is not one of those rote jobs for which digital computers are made to
order.. Cataloging and searching are intellectual tasks, and have been thought
of as rote not because they are menial and straightforward, but because they
are unpalatable and unwanted.. Many people do like to use their minds, yes -
but not for plowing through and discarding irrelevant material..
   Many people have assumed that this would also be the case in information
retrieval.. Accordingly, the rush to put computers to work in this area has led
primarily to their use as searching instruments, and much activity has centered
around the design and operation of searching machinery..  Boundary conditions 
have been assumed, such as an ideal searcher who knows what he wants and who
knows how to express it in terms understood by the machine, and such as ideal
correspondence of descriptors to the documents they describe; then attention 
has been focused on optimizing the processes between these boundaries.. The
resulting theories and systems in most cases seem highly adapted to the needs
of machine but not adapted to the needs of humans..
   We are, after all, dealing with the elemental situation of an author talking
to a reader - even if by means of a buffer storage which will grow more and
more mechanical.. The basic problem is to increase the mental contact between
the reader and the information store, so that the reader can proceed unerringly
and swiftly to identify and receive the message he is looking for..
