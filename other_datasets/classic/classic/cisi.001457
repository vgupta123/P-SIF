World Trends in Library Education
  One of the most significant aspects of the evolution of
librarianship in the twentieth century has been the emergence 
of the library schools as a potent factor in shaping new
philosophies and new attitudes in the library profession.  The
intention of the present work is to examine some of the
implications of this rapid growth in the number of library
schools, noting current trends and possible changes in the
future.  Inevitably, some limitations have had to be imposed,
and there has been a deliberate concentration upon Anglo-
American library education, while at the same time examining
other major patterns of professional education for librarians
which exist in the world, and comparing these with the
approach  of the English speaking countries.  An attempt has
been made to trace the influences which the British and
America systems of library education have had, particularly
in the developing countries.
