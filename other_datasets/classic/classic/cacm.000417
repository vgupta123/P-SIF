Legal Implications of Computer Use
This paper points out a variety of ways computer
systems used in business and industry can 
be involved in legal entanglements and suggests that
computer specialists have a responsibility to call 
for assistance in forestalling or minimizing those entanglements
during the planning stage.  Techniques 
are suggested for making legal clearance effective with
the least burden on the new technology and for 
achieving a favorable legal climate for it generally.
 Computer specialists also are alerted to potential 
opportunities to interpret to lawyers the technical aspects
of computer systems involved in legal situations.
