A Study of Cross-Referencing
   The problem of determining the optimal cross-reference structure for a given 
index and for a given community of users is discussed.. A ross-reference 
structure is represented as a graph in which the nodes are index terms and the 
links are relations between index terms.. In order to clarify the concept of 
'level of cross-referencing' the characteristics of cross-referencing structure
are studied.. Some measures of cross-reference distributions are suggested as a
means of comparing the cross-referencing levels of subject indexes..
   Types of relations linking the terms of cross-references in existing indexes
and thesauri are examined.. The implications of the study for the construction
and testing on indexes and thesauri are discussed..
