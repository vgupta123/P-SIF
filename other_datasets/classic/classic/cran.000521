a note on application of transonic linearization to
an airfoil with a round leading edge .
the profile of a symmetric airfoil of unit length with a round
leading edge can be expressed, in general, as
where p(x) has a finite slope at x = 0 .  it is well known that
the conventional sub- and supersonic linear theories of
compressible flow break down in the neighborhood of such a round
leading edge due to the failure of the small-disturbance
assumption .  the linearized transonic flow theory has the same
short-coming, but if the determination of the sonic point on the airfoil
plays an important role in any more advanced theory--e.g.,
spreiter's local-linearization method or hosokawa's method of
refinement--this theoretical barrier will become more serious
because the sonic point is usually located in a flow region near
the leading edge that may be greatly affected by the roundness .
