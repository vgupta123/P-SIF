Covering Edges by Cliques with Regard to
Keyword Conflicts and Intersection Graphs
Kellerman has presented a method for determining
keyword conflicts and described a heuristic 
algorithm which solves a certain combinatorial optimization
problem in connection with this method.  
This optimization problem is here shown to be equivalent
to the problem of covering the edges of a graph 
by complete subgraphs with the objective of minimizing
the number of complete subgraphs.  A relationship 
between this edge-clique-cover problem and the graph coloring
problem is established which allows algorithms 
for either one of these problems to be constructed
from algorithm for the other.  As consequences of 
this relationship, the keyword conflict problem and the
edge-clique-cover problem are shown to be NP-complete, 
and if P=/NP then they do not admit polynomial-time approximation
algorithms which always produce solutions 
within a factor less than 2 from the optimum.
