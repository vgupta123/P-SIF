The Norms of Citation Behavior: Prolegomena to the Footnote
   The publication explosion has focused renewed attention on the lowly 
footnote.. While we are all at least partially aware of the technical functions
of the citation for both the writer and the reader of the scientific paper, 
little is known about the norms operating in actual practice.. Even less is 
known about the operating norms with respect to the more sociological functions,
including the acknowledgement of intellectual debts or the conferral of 
recognition upon the works of others.. This paper reviews the state of our 
knowledge, raises questions, and proposes suggestions and hypotheses for 
studying the relationships between footnoting practices among scientists and
the social system of science..
