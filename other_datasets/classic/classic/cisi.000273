The Bottomless Pit, or the Academic Library as Viewed from the 
 Administration Building
   Library administrators could adjudge their likely fortunes in the academic 
tug-of war for funds if they understood more clearly the attitudes of 
institutional administrators toward libraries.. Some view the library as "a
bottomless pit"; all recognize that the library is unlikely to generate much
political pressure for its own aggrandizement.. Many young institutional
administrators are coming to apply more sophisticated measures to their funding 
formulas than have been utilized in the past..Librarians therefore would be 
well advised to become more proficient in modern management techniques and 
program budgeting concepts..
