Library Materials
  The problem investigated by the research was the development
of standards for reading materials that would support the adult
new reader in the exercise of his new-found skill and build the habit
of regular use of the printed word.  Bridging the gap between minimal
literacy skills and the reading habit was proposed as essential
to the purposes of the library program in helping the reader improve
has basic education skills, increase his employability, and develop
his potential as a citizen and gain personal satisfaction in his
many adult roles.  The nature of library materials best designed
for this end required study in depth.  The findings and conclusions
derived from the research project provide basic information about the
adult new reader and his reading, criteria for analysis of reading
materials, and a bibliography of materials.  These products of the
study constitute a series of reading selection and guidance aids for
use by all persons working in this area of service -- librarians,
community workers, teachers, publishers, editors, and reading
specialists.
