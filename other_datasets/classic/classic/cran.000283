laminar heat transfer around blunt bodies in dissociated
air .
  a method of predicting laminar heat-transfer rates to blunt,
highly cooled bodies with constant wall temperature in dissociated
air flow is developed .  attention is restricted to the case of
axisymmetric bodies at zero incidence, although two-dimensional
bodies could be treated the same way .  the method is based on
the use of the /local similarity/ concept and an extension of the
ideas used by fay and riddell .  a simple formula is given for
predicting the ratio of local heat-transfer rate to stagnation-point
rate .  it depends on wall conditions and pressure distribution,
but not on the thermodynamic or transport properties of the hot
external flow, except at the stagnation point .
  experimental heat-transfer rates obtained with correct
stagnation-point simulation and high wall cooling in shock tubes are
also presented and compared with the theoretical predictions .
on the whole, the agreement is good, although in regions of
rapidly varying pressure there is evidence that the local similarity
assumption breaks down, and the theory underestimates the
actual heat-transfer rate by up to 25 per cent .
