Analysis of Recorded Biomedical Book and Journal Use in the Yale Medical
Library
Part I. Date and Subject Relations
   Analysis of book and journal circulation is based on cancelled charge slips
collected over a one-year period in the Yale Medical Library.. About two-fifths
of material circulated	were monographs.. Books and journals in seven subject
fields provided over half of the circulation.. Approximately two-thirds of both
books and journals used had been published during the most recent nine years..
A subject-by-subject examination of the ratio of books to journals circulating
revealed that, in subject where proportionally more journals than books were
taken out of the Library, books were of more recent imprint dates than were
journals, contrary to the overall pattern.. Date distribution of books and
journals by subject was also studied.. Results are illustrated with graphs and
tables..
