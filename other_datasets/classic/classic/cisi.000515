A Journal Selection Model and Its Implications for a Library System
   The problem of selecting which journals to acquire in order to best satisfy 
library objectives is modeled as a zero-one linear programming problem and 
examined in detail.. The model incorporates an objective function based on 
expected usage as a measure of journal worth and cost constraints which 
account for the scarcity of capital.. The model can be used to aid the 
librarian in making better selection decisions, since the objective function 
can be shown to reflect the evaluation of the library as an information 
retrieval system and as a service organization.. Moreover, the model of seen to 
be related to inventory problems and scheduling models in industrial 
operations.. 
   Journal usage is discussed as a measure of journal worth and is contrasted 
to journal productivity.. Constraints are considered for scarce resources other 
than capital and for journal interrelationships..
