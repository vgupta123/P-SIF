cooling problem .
  a new method is presented for predicting the boundary-layer
characteristics downstream of the porous region of an
injection-cooled surface .  the method consists of a general scheme for
obtaining nonsimilar solutions of the compressible-
laminar-boundary-layer equations and is formulated along the following
lines .  the viscous domain is divided into n curvilinear strips .
the governing equations are then integrated along the
coordinate normal to the body from the surface to the boundary of each
strip .  as a result, one obtains a set of independent
integro-differential relations .  the integration is carried out by
expressing the integrands as polynomials, the coefficients of which
are functions of the unknown values of the velocity and
temperature on the strip boundaries as well as of the imposed
boundary condition at the wall and at the outer edge .  after the
integration is performed, a set of ordinary first-order differential
equations is obtained .  the set of equations may be solved for
given initial conditions by a numerical integration scheme such
as the runge-kutta method .  several numerical examples of
interest are presented .
