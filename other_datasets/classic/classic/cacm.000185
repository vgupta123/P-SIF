Multiprogram Scheduling Parts 1 and 2.  Introduction and Theory*
In order to exploit fully a fast computer which
possesses simultaneous processing abilities, 
it should to a large extent schedule its own workload.
 The scheduling routine must be capable of extremely 
rapid execution if it is not to prove self-defeating.
 The construction of a schedule entails determining 
which programs are to be run concurrently and which sequentially
with respect to each other.  A concise 
scheduling algorithm is described which tends to minimize
the time for executing the entire pending workload 
(or any subset of it), subject to external constraints
such as precedence, urgency, etc.  The algorithm 
is applicable to a wide class of machines.
