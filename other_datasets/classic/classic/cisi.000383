Evaluation of Micropublishing
  Micropublishing, as it pertains to library materials, is essentially
a form of the republishing of materials no longer in print.  The need
for such materials of many kinds - monographs, serials, newspapers,
reference works - has grown greatly during the past quarter century and
this need is reflected in the growth of the micropublishing industry.  As
new colleges and junior colleges are founded, and established colleges
and universities continue to expand to meet growing educational needs,
both groups of institutions find that in more and more instances the
materials they need are available only in microform.  As a result, the
ratio of microforms to books in college and research libraries has been
steadily rising.
