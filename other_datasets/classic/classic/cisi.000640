The Scientific Premises of Information Science
   Throughout my years of work as an information scientist I have been
plagued by a personal and professional sense of doubt with respect to the
field.. A central theme of every conference that I have attended related
to:  "What is information science?" Or "Is information science a science?"
In this paper I hope to take these questions head on.. I must begin by
saying that I do take information science seriously as a science.. I see
it as the quest for understanding of the nature of information and
man's interaction with it.. That we lack so much in this quest for
understanding is the greatest challenge of the science..
   I intend to explore the tradition, or world view, bearing on the
scientific study of information.. The currently prevalent world view is
the scientific tradition which extends from the Enlightenment to
the present.. I also intend to look critically at what I perceive
to be te premises underlying most of our current efforts to understand
the phenomenon of information.. The criticism will by necessity be
speculative.. I intend to stick my neck out, not because I can prove
my assertions, but because I believe these ideas must be discussed..
