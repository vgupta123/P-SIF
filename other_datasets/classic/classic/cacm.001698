A Statistical Model for Console Behavior in Multiuser Computers
The ability of a computer system to communicate
with the outside world efficiently is as important 
as its ability to perform computations efficiently. 
It is quite difficult to characterize a particular 
user, but rather easy to characterize the entire user community.
 Based on the properties of this community 
we have postulated a hypothetical "virtual console."
 No claim is made that a virtual console behaves 
like any actual console, but the entire collection of
virtual consoles models the collection of actual 
consoles.  Using the model we answer questions like: 
How many processes are suspended waiting for console 
input?  What is the maximum rate at which a process can
execute?  What bounds can be set on overall buffer 
requirements?  Answers to these and similar questions
are needed in certain aspects of operating system 
design.
