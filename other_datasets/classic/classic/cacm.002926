Pagination of B*-Trees with Variable-Length Records
A strategy is presented for pagination of B*-trees
with variable-length records.  If records 
of each length are uniformly distributed within the
file, and if a wide distribution of record lengths 
exists within the file, then this strategy results in shallow
trees with fast access times.  The performance 
of this strategy in an application is presented, compared
with that of another strategy, and analyzed.
