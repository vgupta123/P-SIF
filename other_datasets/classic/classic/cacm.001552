The AED Free Storage Package
The most fundamental underlying problem in sophisticated
software systems involving elaborate, 
changing data structure is dynamic storage allocation
for flexible problem modeling.  The Free Storage 
Package of the AED-1 Compiler Systems allows blocks
of available storage to be obtained and returned 
for reuse.  The total available space is partitioned
into a hierarchy of free storage zones, each of 
which has its own characteristics.  Blocks may be of
any size, and special provisions allow efficient 
handling of selected sizes, control of shattering and
garbage collection, and sharing of physical space 
between zones.  The routines of the package perform
high level functions automatically, but also allow 
access and control of fine internal details as well.
