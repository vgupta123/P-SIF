pitch-yaw stability of a missile oscillating in roll
via the second method of lyapunov .
the stability theory of a. m. lyapunov, a popular topic in
the u.s.s.r., is receiving increasing attention elsewhere .
this note describes lyapunov's /second method/ very briefly
and applies it to an aeronautical stability problem .
