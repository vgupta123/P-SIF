Classification and Indexing in Science
  The first problem, that of learning of a publication's existence, is
tackled by a multiplicity of abstracting and indexing journals and
other bibliographies, and, at local levels, by library catalogues and
unnecessary overlapping among these services, while ensuring
adequately comprehensive coverage, are very great.  But even if
these were overcome, problems of the internal arrangement of these
bibliographical aids would still remain.  It is not enough for them
collectively to record every scientific publication.  The user must be
able to find every such record, starting only with a subject on which
he wants information.
