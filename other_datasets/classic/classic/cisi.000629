Promotion of Information Services: An Evaluation of Alternative Approaches
   This article deals with the promotion of information services, specifically
the formation and subsequent evaluation of different promotional programs
for selective dissemination of information (SDI) services provided by the
Mechanized Information Center (MIC) at the Ohio State University.. Three
programs -- opinion leadership, "blitz," and telephone solicitation -- 
were developed.. Data were collected to show, for each of the programs:  
(1) the level of market penetration achieved; (2) the level of user
satisfaction generated from the service; (3) the effect in terms of
influence, of the various media employed; and (4) cost effectiveness..
Data analysis focused on a determination of the most effective methods
to promote SDI services..
