effects of surface tension and viscosity on taylor
instability .
  the model used is that of two
fluids of infinite depth, with the interface
initially in the form of a sine wave with
amplitude small compared to wave length .
the fluids are considered incompressible,
and only the linear terms in the equations of
hydrodynamics are used .  the first four
sections discuss the effects of surface tension
and viscosity .  the fifth gives a few numerical
results to illustrate the main points of
the preceding sections .
