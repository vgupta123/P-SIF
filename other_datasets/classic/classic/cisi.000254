Chemical Information Systems
  The purpose of a chemical information system must not be restricted
to the storage and retrieval of facts.  It is equally important that the system
shall provide methods which enable a scientist to assemble and to correlate
the facts.  Chemical information systems are required primarily as a service
to research chemists to enable them to keep up to date with current
developments in their fields of interest, and the establishment of information
services has relieved the chemist of many of his problems of literature
searching and information storage and organization.
