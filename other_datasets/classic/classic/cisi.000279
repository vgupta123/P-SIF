Program Budgeting and Cost Benefit Analysis in Library
   Libraries in academic institutions have traditionally prepared annual
budgets based either upon subjective judgments or upon oversimplified 
formulas.. Two budgeting techniques recently introduced into universities from 
the defense establishment are program budgeting and benefit analysis.. Properly
applied they can be utilized to gain better decisions in problems facing 
academic library managers and improved allocation of library resources..
