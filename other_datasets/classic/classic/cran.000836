analytical and experimental investigation of stress distributions in
long flat plates subjected to lingitudinal loads and transverse
temperature gradients .
stress and strain distributions were studied in long flat plates in
order to develop practical analytical procedures for the design
analysis of aircraft structures at elevated temperatures .
various load-temperature conditions are presented . these include ..
methods of analysis for calculation of stress distributions under
and plastic range,.
ture .
experimental verification of the analytical procedures is shown with
comparisons between the use of constant room temperature or temperature
dependent values of modulus of elasticity and coefficient of thermal
expansion .
the test specimen, equipment, instrumentation, and experimental program
are discussed in detail . experimental data obtained from the specimen
and associated material control coupon tests are presented .
