The Paradoxes of Library Cooperation
  The need for libraries to cooperate has long been recognized, as countless
articles written within the past decade will attest.  Moreover, the necessity to
combine forces has never been as apparent as it is today.  Because the cost of 
self-sufficiency has become undeniably prohibitive, libraries can no longer 
afford to act as free agents.  Voluntary library
cooperation is no natural manifestation of social interaction.  Rhetoric alone 
is a impotent agent of change.  In truth, cooperative programs succeed only 
as long as each participant perceives the arrangement as beneficial to his
institution.
