Cataloging Rules ad Principles
  The present study was undertaken pursuant to an assignment
by the Library of Congress.  The author was directed to prepare,
for the Board on Cataloging Policy and Research of the A.L.A.
Division of Cataloging and Classification, a general analysis of the
ALA cataloging rules for author and title entry, with special 
consideration of the rules for corporate authors, and a discussion 
of the objectives and principles which should underlie a revision of the
rules.  The first three parts of the report are directed, respectively,
to the three aspects of this assignment.  The fourth part of the report
was added to deal with general questions raised by readers of a 
preliminary draft of this report.
