Catalog use in a Large Research Library
   Concern with the questions of when and how best to computerize the catalog of
a large research library, and how to improve an existing conventional catalog, 
motivated a study of the utilization of the main catalog of the Yale University 
Library.. The study was carefully designed to provide a representative sample of
catalog use.. Traffic through the catalog area was observed over a period of more
than a year.. A schedule of interviews with catalog users was based on observed 
traffic volume by hour of day, day of week, and time of year.. More than 1,000 
interviews were completed, using nonleading interviewing technique.. Information
was derived on the catalog user's objective, starting clues, and university
affiliation.. Search success was determined.. Follow-up studies were performed 
on the catalog cards and the actual books identified in successful searches.. 
Reasons for search failure were determined for know-item searches.. Availability
and accuracy of different categories of search clues were ascertained.. Published
algorithms for searching computerized bibliographic files were evaluated.. 
Attention is given to the feasibility of automatic construction of computerized 
catalogs.. Some of the available results are presented and discussed..
