renal hyperplasia and neoplasia
in rats given dimethylnitrosamine
multiple foci of hyperplasia and neoplasia were induced in the kidney
of rats that had been dosed orally with dimethylnitrosamine.  the younger rats
and the male sex had a greater incidence of renal tumors.  the hyperplastic
or neoplastic lesions were classified into two groups on the basis of their
histogenesis, namely that of tubular epithelial origin and that of interstitial
cell origin.  dimethylnitrosamine is recommended as a useful chemical
compound for the study of renal carcinogenesis.
