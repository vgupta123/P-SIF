Automated Algebraic Manipulation in Celestial Mechanics
In this paper we consider some of the applications
of automated algebraic manipulation which 
have been made in celestial mechanics.  Particular attention
is paid to the use of Poisson series, and 
a typical problem in perturbation theory is described.
 The requirements of processors for use in celestial 
mechanics are considered and compared with those for general
manipulation packages.  Some future directions 
for research using these systems are briefly outlined.
 To illustrate the relative simplicity of the 
algorithm required in celestial mechanics, a typical
integration problem is considered in an appendix.
