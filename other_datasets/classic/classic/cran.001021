note on creep buckling of columns .
  this paper describes theory and tests of the creep collapse
of long thin aluminum-alloy cylinders under external radial
pressure .  steady-state creep is assumed in the theoretical
derivation .  the test temperatures were between 300 and 500 f .
the collapse time for each cylinder was calculated theoretically .
agreement between theoretical and test results was fair .
