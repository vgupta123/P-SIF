Future Developments in Telecommunications
  Communication technology has entered a period of revolutionary change.
  The last decade has brought new inventions of enormous potential.
It will probably be two decades before we fully grasp the shattering effect
they will have on society.
  These inventions include:
  The communication satellite.  Suddenly this has provided telephone
and television links to the underdeveloped world.  Much larger satellites
will be built and will have an enormous impact on education and
communications both in the United States and throughout the world.  The
satellite antennae in some underdeveloped countries stand next to fields
ploughed by oxen.
  The helical waveguide.  A pipe, now operating, that can carry 250,000
simultaneous telephone calls or equivalent information over long distances.
  The laser.  This means of transmission, still in the research laboratory,
has the potential of carrying many millions of simultaneous telephone calls
or their equivalent.
  Large-scale integration (LSI).  A form of ultraminiaturized computer
circuitry that probably marks the beginning of mass production of
computers and computerlike logic circuitry.  It offers the potential of
extremely reliable, extremely small, and, in some of its forms, extremely
fast computers.  If large-enough quantities can be built, this circuitry can
become very low in cost.
  On-line real-time computers.  Computers capable of responding to many
distant terminals on telecommunication lines at a speed geared to human
thinking.  They have the potential of bringing the power and information
of innumerable computers into every office and eventually every home.
  Picturephone.  A public dial-up telephone system in which subscribers
see as well as hear each other.
  Large TV screens.  TV screens that can occupy a whole wall if necessary.
  Cable TV.  Provides a cable into homes with a potential signal-carrying
capacity more than one thousand times that of the telephone cable.  It
could be used for signals other than television.
  Voice answerback.  Computers can now assembly human-voice words and
speak them over the telephone.  This fact, coupled with the Touchtone
telephone set, makes every such telephone a potential computer terminal.
  Millimeter-wave radio.  Radio at frequencies in the band above the
microwave band can relay a quantity of information greater than all the
other radio bands combined.  Chains of closely spaced antennas will distribute
these millimeter-wave signals.
  Pulse code modulation.  All signals, including telephone, Picturephone,
music, facsimile, and television can be converted into digital bit stream
and transmitted, along with computer data, over the same digital links.
Major advantages accrue from this.
  Computerized switching.  Computerized telephone exchanges are coming into
operation, and computer-like logic can be employed for switching and
"concentrating" all types of signals.
  Data banks.  Electronic storage for huge quantities of information that
can be manipulated and indexed by computers and that can be accessed in a
fraction of a second.
