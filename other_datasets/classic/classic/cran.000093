the supersonic blunt body problem - review and extensions .
  a survey of existing analytical treatments of the supersonic or
hypersonic blunt-body problem indicates that none is adequate
for predicting the details of the flow field .  reasons are given for
the failure of various plausible approximations .  a numerical
method, which is simpler than others proposed, is set forth for
solving the full inviscid equations using a medium-sized electronic
computer .  results are shown from a number of solutions for
bodies that support detached shock waves described by conic
sections .
