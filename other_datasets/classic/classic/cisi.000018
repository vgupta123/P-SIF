Selective Dissemination of Information
  The present contribution does not duplicate previous studies but
complements the earlier publications and closes the few gaps that
exist in the literature prior to 1966 and after 1971.  Additionally,
it is a bold attempt to evaluate critically and objectively the history
of the mechanized selective dissemination of information (SDI) as
reflected in the literature, from the initial description by Luhn
(1958, 1961b, c) to the post-1970 period when the SDI boom began losing
ground to the more popular on-line interactive systems.  The review
therefore questions and interprets the concept of SDI, its implementation,
and its evolution in the light of work performed by many companies,
government agencies, universities, societies, and libraries during the
last fourteen years.
