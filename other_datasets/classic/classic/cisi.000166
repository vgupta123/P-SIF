The Future of Scientific and Technological Publications
  I am sure you do not need reminding of the flood of scientific information
that is available today and the estimates of its growth in the next two
decades.  In 1967, Olaf Helmer, then Senior Mathematician at the Rand
corporation, forecast that scientists and engineers would increase from
five million, in 1967, to twenty-five million by the year 2000 and their
total productivity would go up by a factor of ten.  He declined to assess
the associated growth of, and need for, scientific information but merely
stated that there would be substantial changes in the way in which science
would actually be transacted.  It is these 'substantial changes' that concern
the publisher, editor, information scientist and librarian, because if we
do not anticipate - or at least keep pace with these changes - then we will
not be able to meet the information needs of our readers and we will become
redundant.  Scientific information is a growing industry and it would be
ironic if we could not survive amid an abundance of information.  I regard
the chance to do something about the flow of information as a response to 
opportunity, not as an act of desperation.  The big problem is to sort out
what is pertinent among this information and, in this world of rapid change,
select and develop the technological devices that will match the needs of
the scientist to this mass of information.
