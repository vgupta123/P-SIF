Handbook of the National and International Libraries
  Two methods were used:  (1) A thorough search of professional
literature, principally since 1965, with exceptions in
cases where no later information was available, and (2) direct
communication with associations through a questionnaire and
consultation of supplementary material provided by the associations.
The final result of the authors' search was a total of 319
library associations, 33 international in scope and 286 national
(see Statistical Data).
