Evaluation of a KWIC Index for Library Literature
  A librarian attempting to do a literature search currently
faces an eight-month gap in access to the literature of
his field through Library Literature.  In April 1968,
librarians made a rare examination of their own literature
and considered this gap and other information problems
in librarianship.  The Albany Conference on the Bibliographic
Control of Library Science Literature recommended the
establishment of a fast announcement service for library
schools (1).  A monthly Keyword in Context (KWIC) index
serving the whole range of information-oriented professions 
was a specific proposal which was favored by one conference
group to meet the need for current information (2).
