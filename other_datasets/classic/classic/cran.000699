approximate indical lift functions for several wings of finite span in
incompressible flow as obtained from oscillatory lift coefficients .
the unsteady-lift functions for a wing undergoing a sudden change in
sinking speed have been presented for delta wings having aspect ratios
of 0, 2, and 4 and for rectangular and elliptical wings having aspect
ratios of 0, 3, and 6 . for the elliptical and rectangular wings the
spanwise lift distributions were also presented . these functions were
calculated from the lift coefficients associated with a wing oscillating
 harmonically in pure translational motion, as obtained from several
sources .
the results of these calculations indicate that the normalized
unsteady-lift functions are substantially independent of the shape of
the plan form for elliptical, rectangular, or moderately tapered wings,.
 however, for delta wings the increase of lift toward the steady-state
value is much more rapid than that for the aforementioned wings of the
same aspect ratio . these results also corroborate the results of other
investigations in that the rate of growth of lift tends to increase with
 a decrease in aspect ratio . the shape of the spanwise distributions of
 the indicial lift seems to be, for all practical purposes, independent
of time for rectangular and elliptical wings .
