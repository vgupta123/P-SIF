Complex Gamma Function with Error Control
An algorithm to compute the gamma function and
log gamma function of a complex variable is presented. 
 The standard algorithm is modified in several respects
to insure the continuity of the function value 
and to reduce accumulation of round-off errors.  In
addition to computation of function values, this 
algorithm includes an object-time estimation of round-off
errors.  Experimental data with regard to the 
effectiveness of this error control are presented. 
A Fortran program for the algorithm appears in the 
algorithms section of this issue.
