Human Factors in the Design of an Interactive Library System
   ELMS (Experimental Library Management System) is an experimental
system for total library management, operating on-line with an IBM 360
through IBM 2260 and 2741 terminals.. The system is designed to handle
large amounts of highly variable information which it processes on 
command, giving on-line computer service for all library operations..
At the same time, it must accommodate the different needs and skills
of a broad range of library users, from new patrons to well-trained
librarians..
   Such a system presents programming problems that will be typical
of large, interactive computer systems in the seventies.. This paper
discusses ELMS features that facilitate user interaction, and may prove
useful in similar systems:  techniques for tutoring the user (display
format, one-question, one-answer displays, and KWIC indexing); adaptability
for the experienced user (command chains and a standard set of four-letter
mnemonic codes for higher-level control); minimization of keying (line
numbers, one-character mnemonic codes used with procedures, and use of
default conditions); performance of clerical tasks by exception notification;
and collection of operational statistics to help improve the system..
