Half Rotations in N-Dimensional Euclidean Space
An iterative procedure is described for determining
half rotations in n-dimensional Euclidean 
space. The method is a variant of the cyclic Jacobi
procedure and utilizers elementary plane rotations 
to obtain the half rotation matrix.  Numerical examples are given.
