a study of the application of airfoil section data
to the estimation of the high subsonic speed characteristics
of swept wings .
  estimates of the variation with
mach number of the aerodynamic
characteristics of swept wings are made
on the basis of airfoil section
data combined with span-loading theory .
the analysis deals with
examinations of some 26 wings and wing-body
combinations ranging in sweep
angle from 30 to 60 and for mach
numbers between 0.6 and 1.0 .
  results of the study indicate
that the two-dimensional section data
afford good qualitative information
for such high-speed aerodynamic
characteristics as the variation with
mach number of drag, zero-lift
pitching-moment coefficient, and lift
coefficient for flow separation .
quantitative estimates of the force
and moment divergence mach numbers
could not be made with any degree of
certainty from the airfoil data
alone .  somewhat improved quantitative
estimates for a given
configuration were obtainable by basing the
estimates on the measured
characteristics for a wing of similar plan form
but different section, and
adjusting for the effects of differences in
section on the basis of section data .
