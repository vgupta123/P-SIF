duct flow in magnetohydrodynamics .
  this paper is an extension of the work of hartmann (2) and shercliff
transverse magnetic fields -- the simplest class of magnetohydrodynamic
problems .  we are concerned here mainly with the boundary value
problems associated with flow in ducts with conducting walls .
