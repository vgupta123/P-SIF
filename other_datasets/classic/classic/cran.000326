forst-order slip effects on the compressible laminar
boundary layer over a slender body of revolution in
axial flow .
analysis of the
compressible boundary layer with transverse curvature in first
order slip flow .  no boundary-layer interaction effects are considered
and only the zero pressure-gradient case is examined .
