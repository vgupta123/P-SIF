inviscid hypersonic flow past blunt bodies .
  two methods are shown for the calculation of the flow field
between a blunt body and the shock associated with it for the
case of hypersonic flow .  real gas effects are included .  the
solutions consider only symmetric flows--that is, symmetric
bodies at zero incidence .
  one method consists in tracing successive stream tubes around
the body and leads to iterations on the initially assumed position
of the shock .  the second is an integral method closely analogous
to the karman-pohlhausen procedure for boundary layers .  a
distinction is made between round-nosed and flat-nosed bodies,
and both cases are discussed .
  a specific example corresponding to a re-entry missile situation
is calculated,. the two methods agree within a few per cent .
comparison is also made with other known solutions in the
stagnation region .
