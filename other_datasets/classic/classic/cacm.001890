Simulation of Traffic Flows in a Network
A computer simulation program which deals
with traffic flows in the network of a large area 
is described.  Each road is segmented into blocks of
several ten-meter lengths and is represented by 
a bidirectional list in computer memory.  The movement
of cars, i.e. the transfer of cars from one block 
to the next, is expressed by a proper formula.  This
formula is based on the supposition that the speed 
of cars in a block is determined only by the density of
cars in the block, and this speed-versus-density 
curve is empirically given the numerical values.  This
simulation scheme has its excellent point in that 
it makes it possible to trace the dynamic behavior
of traffic flows in a variety of situations, some 
examples of which are given for an actual area of the city of Kyoto, Japan.
