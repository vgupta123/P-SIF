HYDRA: The Kernel of a Multiprocessor Operating System
This paper describes the design philosophy of
HYDRA-the kernel of an operating system for C.mmp, 
the Carnegie-Mellon Multi-Mini-Processor.  This philosophy
is realized through the introduction of a 
generalized notion of "resource", both physical and virtual,
called an "object".  Mechanisms are presented 
for dealing with objects, including the creation of new
types, specification of new operations applicable 
to a given type, sharing, and protection of any reference
to a given object against improper application 
of any of the operations defined with respect to that
type of object.  The mechanisms provide a coherent 
basis for extension of the system in two directions: the
introduction of new facilities, and the creation 
of highly secure systems.
