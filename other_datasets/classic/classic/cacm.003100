An Interference Matching Technique for Inducing Abstractions
A method for inducing knowledge by abstraction
from a sequence of training examples is described. 
 The proposed method, interference matching, induces abstractions
by finding relational properties common 
to two or more exemplars.  Three tasks solved by a program
that uses an interference-matching algorithm 
are presented.  Several problems concerning the description
of the training examples and the adequacy 
of interference matching are discussed, and directions
for future research are considered.
