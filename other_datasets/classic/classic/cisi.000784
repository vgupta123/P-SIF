Documentation Notes
  I would suggest three possible reasons for the constant average number of
references per article.  Firstly, on average, articles more than fifteen years
old rarely get cited as they are rendered obsolete by the rate of advance.  The
net increase per annum of 'citeable articles' is not as large as might otherwise
be expected.
  Secondly many relatively small specialized subject areas, each tending to
have its own literature and 'internal' citation practices, are hiving off from
the classical areas, because of the specialized nature of modern science.
  Thirdly it seems that the 'building blocks' of an article can on average
be adequately specified (regardless of the volume of published information)
by reference to about eleven items of the prior art relating to the main
theme, associated concepts and methods, and general background.
