A Base for a Mobile Programming System
An algorithm for a macro processor which has
been used as the base of an implementation, by 
bootstrapping, of processors for programming languages is
described.  This algorithm can be easily implemented 
on contemporary computing machines.  Experience with
programming languages whose implementation is based
on this algorithm indicates that such a language can
be transferred to a new machine in less than one 
man-week without using the old machine.
