periodic temperature distribution in a two-layer composite slab .
in a recent contribution to the reader's forum, under the above title,
stonecypher outlined a method for finding the periodic temperature
distribution in a two-layer composite slab, one exposed surface of the slab
being insulated and the other subject to a sinusoidal temperature
variation .  perfect thermal contact between the two layers, and constant
thermal properties were assumed .
two years ago i drew attention in these pages to a method for
determining the transient temperature in such a two-layer slab resulting from a
triangular heat-input pulse .  i should like to point out that this same
method also is applicable to the case where one external face is given
a sinusoidal temperature variation with time .  the method is based on
the analogy between one-dimensional heat flow and the flow of an
electric current in a simple transmission line having only series resistance
and parallel capacitance .
