Experiments with an Automated Instructional System for Numerical Methods
A computer system was developed at Purdue
University to teach portions of an undergraduate 
course in numerical methods.  Each instructional unit
or lesson is divided into three modes of instruction 
which allow the student to press from a computer-controlled
presentation to a student-controlled investigation. 
The system is designed as a classroom-independent course
of study, and has been used for two semesters 
by students in lieu of conventional classroom instruction.
 Initial measures of effectiveness, student 
acceptance, and operational cost are the result of testing
the system independent of instructor intervention. 
 The system is operational on a CDC 6500 with teletype terminals.
