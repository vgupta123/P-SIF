An Approach to Multidimensional Data Array Processing by Computer
Some recent work on the development of general-purpose
computer-based statistical and data 
processing capabilities for handling multidimensional
arrays of data is presented. Attention is first 
given to some of the general problems of multidimensional
table and array processing.  This is followed 
by a summary of some recent developments in array processing
capabilities at the World Bank, in particular, 
the system identified as WRAPS(World Bank
Retrieval and Array Processing System).
