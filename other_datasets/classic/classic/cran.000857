experimental studies of flutter of buckled rectangular
panels at mach numbers from 1. 2 to 3. 0 including
effects of pressure differential and of panel
width-length ratio .
  experimental panel flutter data have been obtained at mach numbers
from 1.2 to 3.0 for buckled rectangular panels and the effect of a
pressure differential has been determined .  increasing the pressure
differential was effective in eliminating flutter on most of the panels
tested .  the effects of the variables in the panel flutter parameter
sure, e is young's modulus, and t and l are the panel thickness and
length, respectively) were investigated for buckled panels clamped on
the front and rear edges and a critical value of this parameter of 0.44
is indicated at zero pressure differential when the panel width-length
ratio is 0.69 .  an estimated flutter boundary is presented for buckled
panels clamped on four edges, with width-length ratios of 0.21 to 4.0 .
this boundary shows that the panel width is more significant than the
panel length when the ratio of width to length is less than
approximately 0.5 .  panels clamped on four edges and buckled in two half waves
in the direction of flow were found to be particularly susceptible to
flutter .  the results of limited tests on panels with applied damping,
curvature, and lengthwise stiffeners are also presented and discussed .
