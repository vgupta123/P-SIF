Performance and Cost of "Free-Text" Search systems
  The purpose of an information-retrieval system is to provide the user with
citations relevant to his query.  Since the user is the only person competent
to make the final judgement of relevance it is natural to suppose that the
selection of items from a data base will lead to two kinds of retrieval
error.  The extent of these errors is expressed by the familiar measures
of performance, precision and recall.  Precision measures the failure of the
system to retrieve only relevant documents while recall measures its failure
to retrieve all relevant documents actually present in the data base.  It is
difficult to visualize a situation in which a user would find advantage in
being provided with irrelevant citations.  From the user's point of view,
therefore, a system which offers less than 100 per cent precision is a
deficient system.
