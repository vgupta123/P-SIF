A Survey of Computer Science Offerings In Small Liberal Arts Colleges.
Recent curricular development in computer science
together with student in terest in pursuing 
topics in computer science beyond the usual programming
courses have encouraged small liberal arts colleges 
to expand their offerings.  This paper summarizes the
results of a survey taken to determine the type 
of computer science programs being offered in these
colleges.  The results indicate that over half of 
these colleges either have no computer science
program or offer only programming courses.
