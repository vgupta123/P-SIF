A Bibliometric Analysis of Certain Information Science Literature
   Several bibliometric techniques previously applied to 
separate scientific literatures were used together in the analysis of a
single corpus of journal articles relating to information science.. 
Techniques included are (a) Bradford analysis, (b) epidemic analysis, 
(c) identification of research front, and (d) bibliographic coupling.. 
Similar analysis was made of writings cited by the main corpus articles, 
and of the literature which in turn cites the main corpus.. Results
were analyzed in terms of structure and processes observable in patterns
of authorship, publication, and citation.. Their significance is discussed
with potential application of the method to the solution of problems in the
management of large research libraries..
