the tissue reaction to hyperbaric oxygen .                              
  hyperbaric oxygen damages tissues exposed in vitro, but their         
sensitivity varies . if exposure is limited some tissues may recover .  
the effect appears to depend on oxygen tension rather than raised       
pressure per se . the tissue reaction may be involved in the clinical   
application of hyperbaric oxygen .
