Measuring Readers' Failure at the Shelf
   This paper is concerned with the availability of books known to be held by 
the Library.. It outlines a simple survey method whereby readers record the 
non-availability of books which they are looking for.. The survey has already
been installed at four university libraries, but the results from only one 
library are considered here.. These results show how a librarian can find out
the degree of non-availability or failure in any particular area of the library,
the causes of failure, and even the particular items which are in heavy demand
and not available..
   They also provide information on the degree of co-operation by the readers, 
the number of titles failing once, twice, three times etc., the overlap of 
demand for popular books by different groups of borrowers, the waiting time for 
books that failed, the pattern of demand for particular books over a period of 
time, the relationship between failure and recall, the correlation of failure 
from one term to the next, and the relative use of books inside and outside the 
library..
   From the results it was possible to recommend certain changes in library 
procedure which should have reduced failure, and to compare the titles of books
failing in the Main Library with the holdings of a departmental library.. The 
time spent on the survey and the total cost of the survey are also given..
