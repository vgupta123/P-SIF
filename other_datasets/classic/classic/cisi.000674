Installation and Operation of a Registry for Chemical Compounds
  Since 1958 the Chemical Abstracts Service has been
working toward establishing a computer-based system for
handling chemical information.  Briefly, the concept of
the CAS system consists of sets of special subject files
in the following categories: (1) physical properties, (2)
chemical reactivities, (3) biochemical activities, and (4)
applications.  With the importance of compounds in
correlation studies, and the need to interrelate compounds
and the huge collections of chemical and other data, a
highly developed subsystem, called the Registry System,
for handling compounds must be the first step in the
actual operation of an over-all computer-based service.
The Registry System will include files of compounds 
interconnected with files of associated data that permit
identifying the compounds and retrieving them from the
files.
