Some Techniques for Using Pseudorandom Numbers in Computer Simulation
An algorithm is described by which uniform pseudorandom
integers may be used to construct binary 
"numbers" in which the probability that each bit in the
word is a 1-bit and can assume any desired parameter 
value.  Techniques for making use of such "numbers"
in simulation programming are described.
