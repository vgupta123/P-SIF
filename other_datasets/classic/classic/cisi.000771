Survey of Information Needs of Physicists and Chemists
  Scientific research is expensive and the practical application of its
results is even more expensive.  Information services are relatively
inexpensive and, by constantly improving their scope and efficiency and
encouraging the scientist to make the best use of them, we can minimize
duplication and inefficiency in research and development.  This is the
justification for the present survey and for all the work on user needs
which has preceded it.
