An Interactive Display for Approximation by Linear Programming
An interactive program
with a graphical display has been developed for the approximation of
data by means of a linear combination of functions (including
splines) selected by the user.  The coefficients of the approximation
are determined by linear programming so as to minimize the error
in either the L1 or L-infinity norm.  Auxiliary conditions such as
monotonicity or convexity of the approximation can also be imposed. This
interactive system is described and several examples of its use are given.
