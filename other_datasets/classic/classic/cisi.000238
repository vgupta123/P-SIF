Book Selection and Censorship
  When is a librarian's decision not to include a book in his library
collection an act of book selection, and when is it censorship?  Is there, 
in fact, any discernible difference in the two terms: book selection and
censorship?  This topic was discussed so lucidly and ably, long ago, by
Lester Asheim in what has become a classic essay in the literature of
librarianship, "Not Censorship, but Selection," that raising it again
may appear to be an exercise in redundancy.
