Computer Assisted Indexing
   The paper describes a technique which enables an on line computer based
information retrieval system to aid the indexers by selecting possible index 
terms to be assigned to a new document entering the system..
   The method analyses the index terms assigned to the references cited by the 
new article.. This produces a list of index terms weighted according to their 
expected correlation with the subject matter of the new article.. Thus, the 
indexer is presented with the weighted list of proposed indexing terms as an 
aid..
   An evaluation is made of the results produced by the technique for a trial
set of documents.. These documents have already been indexed for the MEDLARS 
system.. The list of actual index terms for this trial set of documents is 
compared with the set of index terms proposed by the technique for each 
document.. The results of this comparison are encouraging, and they are 
discussed in the paper..
   The economic aspects of implementing the technique in a working information 
retrieval system is considered.. This included the expected benefits, and an 
estimate of the cost of using the technique as an aid in terms of computer 
time and indexer time..
