Correlation the Subjects of Books Taken Out Of and Books Used Within an 
Open-Stack Library
   The traditional over-the-counter circulation count is not always considered 
a reliable indicator of total library use.. To test this assumption the author
hypothesized that no correlation exists between the subjects of books taken out
of the library and those used within the library.. Counts were made of books 
left on tables, chairs, desks, and other surfaces and correlated to books 
charged out.. Two studies were made.. In the first, books were counted within 
finely delineated LC and Dewey class spans relating to academic departments..
In the second, books were counted within the broad LC first and second letters 
and the Dewey tens.. In the first case, the overall correlation was .86; in the
second, with less data, .84.. The author concludes that out-of-library 
circulation totals can be reliable indicators of in-library use.. For predicting
in-library use (and thus total use) two methods are cited-simple ratio of out 
to in, and the regression equation..
