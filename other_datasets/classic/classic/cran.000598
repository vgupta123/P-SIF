new test techniques for a hypervelocity wind tunnel .
the measurement of rocket exhaust effects on vehicle stability and the
measurement of aerodynamic damping were made in an arc-discharge type of
 hypervelocity wind tunnel . sample data are given to indicate the
quality of data obtainable in this tunnel, and samples of self-luminous
and shadowgraph photographs are also presented .
