Measuring Classified Circulation According to Curriculum
   Circulation statistics can be precise reflections of library use according 
to the curriculum.. The statistics can help the librarian decide how to 
allocate the budget to departments.. Traditional counts, by department 
personnel or by broad Dewey or LC classes, are imprecise.. An analogy between
curriculum and circulation can be constructed by classifying courses in the
college catalog (by DC or LC), rearranging the numbers thus generated by 
department, and then counting circulation within those groups.. The analogy is
thus a quantitative measure and a precise reflection of library use according
to curriculum..
