answered by a random sampling study.. Use of this time and money saving 
technique requires no special mathematical ability or statistical background..
The concept of accuracy is discussed and a table is provided to simplify the
determination of an appropriate sample size.. A method of selecting a sample 
using random numbers is shown.. Three examples illustrate the application of 
the technique to library problems..
