Chemical and Engineering News
  Chemical Abstracts Service, along with the entire ACS publications
program, is converting to a computer base.  This change in our basic method
of handling information will provide powerful new tools for chemists and
chemical engineers to meet their information needs.
  Our goal is a unified system that will produce both a full, printed record
of chemical and chemical engineering knowledge and a variety of timely,
special-subject alerting services, simultaneously providing a mechanized
match and retrieval system that is sufficiently flexible to meet the varied
needs of information users.  The output will be supplied in whatever form
best suits the user's needs - printed pages, microfilm, or computer-searchable
tapes.  Tapes and search programs will be usable on the customer's computer,
or CAS will provide custom matches of its own computer files.
