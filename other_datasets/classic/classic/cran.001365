approximate calculation of the laminar boundary layer .
  after analyzing a large class of boundary-layer
velocity-profiles, the author discovered that the functions l(m) and
h(m) for all such cases differ only slightly from each other
over the whole range of positive and negative pressure
gradients .  here l, m and h are defined by
being the
velocity-component in the x direction and u the value of u at the
edge of the boundary-layer and and the displacement
and momentum thickness, respectively .  based on this
discovery, an approximate method is proposed by constructing
two universal curves l(m) and h(m) for all conceivable
boundary-layer flows found in practice .  once these are
chosen, karman's momentum-integral can be written in the
form, v being the kinematic
viscosity coefficient, and can be integrated numerically .  as
examples, both howarth's and hartree's
tained is considered good for practical purposes .
