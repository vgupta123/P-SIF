on the bending of circular cylindrical shells under
pure bending .
the stability of circular cylindrical shells under pure bending is
investigated by means of batdorf's modified donnell's equation and the
galerkin method .  the results of this investigation have shown that,
contrary to the commonly accepted value, the maximum critical bending
stress is for all practical purposes equal to the critical compressive
stress .
