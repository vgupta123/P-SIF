experimental investigation of the downstream influence
of stagnation point mass transfer .
  this report presents the results of an experimental
investigation of the downstream influence of localized mass transfer in the
stagnation region of a blunt body under hypersonic flow
conditions .  the coolant is injected through a porous plug coaxial
with the centerline of symmetry of the model .  the tests were
carried out in a wind tunnel with a mach number of 6.0,
stagnation temperatures of approximately 1,600 r., and a stagnation
pressure of approximately 600 psia .  four different gases were
injected over a range of mass flows .  the heat transfer on the
impermeable section was measured under isothermal wall
conditions,. for the higher rates of mass flow, adiabatic surface
temperatures were also determined .  the theoretical analysis of the
boundary-layer flow is investigated in order to establish the
similarity parameters for the flow system .  these parameters permit
the extrapolation of the test results to other flow conditions,
provided that laminar flow prevails .  helium is found to be the
most efficacious coolant .
