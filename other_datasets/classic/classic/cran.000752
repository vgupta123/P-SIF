slender not-so-thin wing theory .
  a method for making an approximate thickness correction to slender
thin-wing theory is presented .  the method is tested by applying it to
cones with rhombic cross-sections and the agreement is found to be good
if the cones are not too thick .  it is then suggested that the
thickness correction to slender thin-wing theory may be applied
unchanged to linear thin-wing theory .  this suggestion is compared with
some experiments on delta wings and it is found that there is
considerable improvement over thin-wing theory near the centre line, but that
this improvement is not maintained as the wing tips are approached .
