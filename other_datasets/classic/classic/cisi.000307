Providing Access to Externally Available Bibliographic Data Bases 
 in an Academic Library
   The ready availability of externally processed bibliographic data based has 
made it possible for an academic library to provide computerized searches on a
large number of data bases with a very small initial investment and utilizing 
its own personnel.. The experience of the University of Pennsylvania Libraries 
has confirmed that such an approach is indeed feasible. This article discusses 
the approach, questions and problems encountered, and the factors considered in
their resolution.. Also discussed are the role of the data services librarian, 
the cost incurred, and some observations as to the philosophy of the approach, 
with particular attention to the integration of the service into the reference 
department..
