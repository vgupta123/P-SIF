clinical experience with
primary hyperparathyroidism:
evaluation of treatment
forty-four patients with "operatively proven" hyperparathyroidism were
evaluated to decide 1) whether or not the diagnosis could be substantiated
by some postoperative observations other than the gross anatomic diagnosis
of the operative specimen and 2) what the long term value of operative
treatment would be.  it was found that an immediate and significant fall
in urinary phosphorus excretion best documented the diagnosis of primary
hyperparathyroidism.  over intervals up to 10 years, follow-up of the
patients suggested a favourable response of the disease to operative
treatment.
