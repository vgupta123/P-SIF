stagnation point heat transfer measurements at super
satellite speeds .
  brief description of experiments performed by using shock tube
techniques for measurement of the stagnation point heating of a blunt
body over a stagnation enthalpy range of 650 to 900,
corresponding to velocities between 32,000 ft. per sec. and 39,000
ft per sec., respectively .  data thus provided are used for
comparison with theory .
