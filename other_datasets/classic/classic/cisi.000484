Negotiation of Inquiries in an On-Line Retrieval System
The focus of discussion is a prototype retrieval system with three major 
components for text processing, connectivity and decision operations.. Each of
these components is based on a distinguishable subtheory..
   Computer programs for the first two components have been written for a GE 
225 computer.. The complete prototype system is now being programmed for 
operation in a time-shared environment.. It is a user-oriented system, with 
planned capabilities for the browsing and man-machine interaction..
A major goal is to develop procedures whereby research workers can conduct an 
on-line dialog via terminals with a body of scientific information.. Each 
user-submitted inquiry is a set of sentences without restriction as to 
vocabulary or form.. The system converses with the user to obtain 
source-derived phrases that elaborate and refine the initial inquiry.. The use is
led to browse in the general area of his inquiry and to broaden or narrow it as
a further aid to request formulation..
   Evaluation of system performance is described..
