Procedure-Oriented Language Statements to Facilitate Parallel Processing
Two statements are suggested which allow a programmer
writing in a procedure-oriented language 
to indicate sections of program which are to be executed
in parallel.  The statements are DO TOGETHER 
and HOLD.  These serve partly as brackets in establishing
a range of parallel operation and partly to 
define each parallel path within this range.  DO TOGETHERs
may be nested.  The statements should be particularly 
effective for use with computing devices capable of
attaining some degree of compute-compute overlap.
