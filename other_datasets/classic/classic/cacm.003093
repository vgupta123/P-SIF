Automatic Error Recovery for LR Parsers
In this paper we present a scheme for detecting
and recovering from syntax errors in programs. 
 The scheme, which is based on LR parsing, is driven
by information which is directly and automatically 
obtainable from the information that is already present
in an LR parser.  The approach, which is patterned 
after that of Levy and Graham and Rhodes, appears to
provide error recovery which is both simple and 
powerful.
