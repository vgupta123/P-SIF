A Language Extension for Expressing Constraints on Data Access
Controlled sharing of information is needed and
desirable for many applications and is supported 
in operating systems by access control mechanisms.  This
paper shows how to extend programming languages 
to provide controlled sharing.  The extension permits
expression of access constraints on shared data. 
 Access constraints can apply both to simple objects, and
to objects that are components of larger objects, 
such as bank account records in a bank's data base.
 The constraints are stated declaratively, and can 
be enforced by static checking similar to type checking.
 The approach can be used to extend any strongly-typed 
language, but is particularly suitable for extending
languages that support the notion of abstract data 
types.
