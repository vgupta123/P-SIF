heat transfer for laminar flow in an annulus with porous
wall .
  temperature profiles and heat-transfer rates of established
incompressible flow through an annulus channel with porous walls
of constant temperatures are determined at different injection rates .
axial conduction and viscous dissipation are, as usual, neglected .
injecting fluid is tacitly assumed to have the same temperature as
the porous wall .
