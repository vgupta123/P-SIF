on the propagation and structure of the blast wave .
 part 1.
  as a continuation of part 1 (j. phys. soc. japan 8 (1953) 662), the
second approximation for the propagation and structure of a blast
wave is now discussed .  the solution for r=1.4 is obtained by a
numerical method, using the results of the first approximation obtained
in part 1 .  by use of this solution, u-r curves, distance-time curves
and the changing feature of distributions of velocity, pressure and
density behind the shock front are discussed .
  further, the approximate solution of the equation is discussed by
a refinement of the wkb method due to imai .
