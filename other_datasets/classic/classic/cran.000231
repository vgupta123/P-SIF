practical calculation of second-order supersonic flow
past non-lifting bodies of revolution .
  calculation of second-order supersonic flow past bodies of
revolution at zero angle of attack is described in detail, and reduced to
routine computation .  use of an approximate tangency condition is shown
to increase the accuracy for bodies with corners .  tables of basic
functions and standard computing forms are presented .  the procedure is
summarized so that one can apply it without necessarily understanding
the details of the theory .  a sample calculation is given, and several
examples are compared with solutions calculated by the method of
characteristics .
