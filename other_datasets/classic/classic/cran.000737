on the analysis of elastic plates of variable thickness .
  the extensional and flexural equations
governing the elastic behaviour of a plate
of variable thickness are expressed in
terms of the laplacian operator .
temperature variations in the plane of the
plate and across the thickness of the plate
are taken into account .
  general solutions are given for a rectangular
plate whose thickness varies
exponentially along the length, and for a circular,
or annular, plate whose thickness varies
as a power of the radius .
  the large-deflexion equations, including
effects of initial irregularities, are also
discussed .
