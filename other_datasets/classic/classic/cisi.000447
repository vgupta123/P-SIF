A Note on the Concept of "Relevance"
  Two recent articles in this journal (Konigova [1], Cooper [2]) have gone
beyond the usual slapdash use of the words "relevant" and "relevance," and
have attempted to explicate the concept further.  Both attempts only partially
succeed.  Konigova proposes three types:  formal relevance, subject/content
relevance and subjective relevance (or pertinency).  This classification has
validity, but is not further elaborated, and indeed she reverts to a less
precise language; for example, in defining "second order noise," she uses the
ambiguous phrase "a formally relevant document which is not really relevant" -
presumably meaning not subjectively relevant, according to the real need of
the enquirer.  And in her mathematics, as she admits, "no account is taken of
the subjective relevance (pertinence)."  Yet this is surely the true aim of the
system.
