determination of lift or drag programs to minimize
re-entry heating .
  a study of single-pass re-entry from escape speed and from
circular satellite speed is made to determine the lift program for a
hypersonic glider and the drag-modulation program for a
non-lifting vehicle that minimize the heating of the vehicles within
acceleration or range constraints .  a new method of numerical
solution is used, similar to kelley's /method of gradients,/ that
permits rapid convergence to the optimum lift program starting
with an original good estimate .  this method avoids the
two-point boundary-value problem of the calculus-of-variations
formulation, and is applicable to any optimum-programing
problem .  an acceleration-tolerance limit is introduced which
describes the human pilot's capability to withstand acceleration
more accurately than a simple acceleration limit .
