The Use of Older Literature and Its Obsolescence
   Terminalogy and parameters for describing the relation between figures for
the use of library literature and for its age are discussed.. Unless a 
correction for growth is applied, half-life fails a simple test of suitability,
as do Brookes's aging and utility factors.. Results based on cumulated data
have other important disadvantages.. Relative 'use-per-item' figures are 
satisfactory.. The need to relate terminology more closely to the facts they
represent is stressed: item-consultation decay rate, and 50% consultation 
probability age are suggested and defined.. In the context of citation studies,
item-citation decay rate and 50% citation probability age are equivalent and 
avoid similar objections..
   In data from NRLSI, item-consultation decay rates are only approximately 
exponential.. Different rates are demonstrated for updating and basic searches,
for academic and other types of readers, and for types of literature.. For some
historical searches negative decay rates were found in the NRLSI and BML..
