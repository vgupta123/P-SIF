knudsen flow through a circular capillary .
the problem of knudsen flow through a circular capillary has been
often discussed, usually by the momentum transfer method .  however,
p. clausing gave a rigorous formulation for the problem and obtained an
integral equation for which he gave an approximate solution .  from
time to time the accuracy of clausing's solution has been questioned
and since clausing did not give a rigorous estimate of his error we
have reinvestigated the problem .
