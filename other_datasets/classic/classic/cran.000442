  an experimental investigation has been made of some effects of
variations in several parameters, including fluid density, on the
flutter characteristics of light uniform cantilever wings .  the
assortment of wings tested covered a variety of positions of the elastic axis
and center of gravity and values of the aspect ratio of 8, 6, and 4 .
the relative-density parameter (where k is representative of the
ratio of fluid density to wing mass) was varied over a range of values
from 1.2 to nearly 14 .  special emphasis has been placed on the lower
values .
  the experimental investigation has been supplemented by an
analytical investigation based on the two-dimensional aerodynamic theory for
incompressible flow .  in a few instances corrections for the effects of
finite span have been made .  in general, the theoretical results
followed the trends indicated by experiment except at very low values of
the relative-density parameter .  for these low values
the analytical considerations employed indicated a freedom from flutter
not found experimentally .  at higher values of the flutter-speed
coefficient is shown to decrease with decreasing values of and
to be nearly proportional to the inverse of the square root of the air
density .
