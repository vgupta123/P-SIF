  several blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for
atmospheric reentry vehicles were tested to determine the aerodynamic
characteristics of such shapes for angles of attack up to 34 .  the tests
were conducted through the transonic mach number range and at reynolds
numbers from 1.74 x 10 to 2.78 x 10, based on body diameter .
  a full-skirted rather than a short-skirted type of shape developed
the greatest amount of static stability and the largest lift-curve
slopes .  the angle of attack for maximum lift for such bodies appears
to be subject to mach number effects .  spinning a full-skirted body
about its longitudinal axis generally increased the lift and reduced the
pitching moment at angles of attack and reduced the aerodynamic static
stability parameter through the transonic mach number range .  the
extension of segmented clamshell-shaped flaps from the afterbody of a
short-skirted model served to increase the lift and static stability
only if the flaps extended into the airstream .
  some evidence was found of oscillatory base pressures on two
dissimilar shapes at certain high angles of attack and the highest mach
number in these tests .  there is doubt, however, that these pressures
can induce any significant oscillatory motion for a reentry vehicle
because of their small amplitude and phasing .
