Guidelines for Library Automation; a Handbook for Federal
and Other Libraries
  This book is one of the products of a contract initiated by the Automation
Task Force of the Federal Library Committee, sponsored and monitored by the
U.S. Office of Education, and carried out by the System Development 
Corporation.  The project included a questionnaire survey of all Federal
libraries (2104), as of December, 1970, to gather systems planning data and 
to identify Federal libraries with operational or planned automated systems.
Respondents in the latter group were sent a Federal Library Automation Survey
questionnaire requesting specific details about existing and planned systems.
From these sources, amplified by visits to Federal libraries and an extensive
review of the automation literature, information was distilled for use in
this Handbook.
