formulae for use with the fatigue load meter in the
assessment of wing fatigue life .
  this note gives a method for the derivation of suitable constants
which, when multiplied by the readings recorded at each appropriate
acceleration level on a fatigue load meter and then added together, give
directly the proportion of fatigue life used up in the wing .  it is
suggested that when the estimated proportion is of order 80, then a more
detailed assessment of fatigue life should be made .
