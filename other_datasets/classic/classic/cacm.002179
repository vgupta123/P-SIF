Simple LR(k) Grammars
A class of context-free grammars, called the
"Simple LR(k)" or SLR(k) grammars is defined. 
 This class has been shown to include weak precedence
and simple precedence grammars as proper subsets. 
 How to construct parsers for the SLR(k) grammars is
also shown.  These parser-construction techniques 
are extendible to cover all of the LR(k) grammars of
Knuth; they have been implemented and by direct 
comparison proved to be superior to precedence techniques,
not only in the range of grammars covered, 
but also in the speed of parser construction and
in the size and speed of the resulting parsers.
