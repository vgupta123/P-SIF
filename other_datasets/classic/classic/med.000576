long-term treatment of hypopituitary and of
achondroplastic dwarfism with human
growth hormone
we have treated an 8 year old hypopi-
tuitary dwarf intermittently with hgh
(wilhelmi) for 4 years.  with 1 mg. 3
times a week the monthly growth rate
was 1/4 inch.  as treatment continued he
became resistant.  increasing the dosage
to 3 mg. 3 times a week at the age of 12
induced a monthly growth rate of 2/5
inch.  this growth-promoting effect is at
least as great as that reported for the
li and raben preparations.  we have
also treated a 15 year old severely de-
formed 'achondroplastic' dwarf for a
year.  with 3 mg. 3 times a week he
grew 1/2 inch in the first month.  the
spurt in growth subsided.  with 5
mg. 3 times a week he grew another 1/2 inch
in a month, but growth was not main-
tained.
