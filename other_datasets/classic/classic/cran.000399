conduction of heat in composite slabs .
conduction of heat in composite slabs .
a method of calculating the total quantity of heat that passes through a
 unit area from zero time to time t is developed . allowance is made for
 surface resistance by regarding each contact resistance as an
additional layer of the appropriate thermal resistance and zero heat
capacity
