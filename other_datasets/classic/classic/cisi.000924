Library Education and Training
    The Conference on Library Education and Training in
Developing Countries was arranged in order (1) to examine
more closely the present facilities, curricula, and programs
for training library workers in the developing countries
of the world closest to Hawaii, those in East and South
Asia; (2) to determine their short- and long-range needs
for trained library workers; and (3) to determine their
needs for additional library education and training facilities
and for revised curricula.  In the light of this information
the Conference proposed to evaluate the assistance given
in recent years by American advisors and temporary library school 
faculty in these countries, and then to ascertain the roles
that both local library schools and their counterparts in the
United States can play in serving the needs for trained
library workers in these and other developing countries.
