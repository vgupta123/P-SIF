the flow of fluid along cylinders .
the boundary layer equations for uniform flow parallel to the generators
 of any cylinder without corners are put into the form of a series of
linear third-order differential equations . the first three of these are
 the same as those obtained by seban and bond /1/ for a circular
cylinder and solved by kelly /2/ . the rest have additional terms
depending on the radius of curvature of the cylinder and its derivatives . the
 problem is also attacked by a pohlhausen method as far as four terms of
 the series . for large distances from the front, rayleigh's method, as
given by hasimoto /3/, gives the first two terms of an asymptotic
expansion for the drag . explicit calculations are made of the drag of
an elliptic cylinder of eccentricity 1/2 3 . there is evidence that the
drag is everywhere less than that of a circular cylinder of the same
perimeter .
