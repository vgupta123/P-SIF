Matrix Reduction-An Efficient Method
The paper describes an efficient method for
reduction of the binary matrices which arise in 
some school time-tabling problems.  It is a development
of that described by John Lions.  It has been 
generalized and adapted to fit into the complete timetabling
process; to use a more compact data representation 
and more efficient processing techniques; to take fuller
advantage of possible available previous knowledge 
about the matrix.  And it is designed as a structured
program, which can readily be coded by the reader 
in the high level or low level programming language
of his choice.  Practical tests of the method have 
shown it to be a good basis for a realistic timetabling algorithm.
