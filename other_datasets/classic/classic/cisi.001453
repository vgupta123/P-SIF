Women in Librarianship
  There are some who question whether the status of women in the
library profession is a major issue.  A survey of library literature,
however shows an increase in the factual data available regarding
differences between men and women in salaries, promotional patterns
and other professional situations. There are local library groups
which are examining the status of women in their own libraries and
organizing to improve their employment situations.  On the state
and national level, conference programs and workshops at library
association meetings have dealt with various aspects of sex
discrimination, affirmative action policies, sexism in children's
materials and the like.
