A Scientific Theory of Classification and Indexing 
and Its Practical Application
   A classification is a theory of the structure of knowledge.. From a 
discussion of the nature of truth, it is held that scientific knowledge is the 
only knowledge which can be regarded as true.. The method of induction from 
empirical data is therefore applied to the construction of a classification..
Items of knowledge are divided into uniquely definable terms, called isolates,
and the relations between them, called operators.. It is shown that only four
basic operators exist, expressing appurtenance, equivalence, reaction, and
causation; using symbols for these operators, all subjects can be analysed in a
linear form called an analet.. With the addition of the permissible permutations
of such analets, formed according to simple rules, alphabetical arrangement of 
the first terms provides a complete, logical subject index.. Examples are given,
and possible difficulties are considered.. A classification can then be
constructed by selection of deductive relations, arranged in hierarchical form..
The nature of possible classifications is discussed.. It is claimed that such an
inductively constructed classification is the only true representation of the
structure of knowledge, and that these principles provide a simple technique
for accurately and fully indexing and classifying any given set of data, with
complete flexibility..
