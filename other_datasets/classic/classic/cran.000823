plastic torsional buckling strength of cylinders including
the effects of imperfections .
  the torsional buckling strength of a cylinder in the plastic
range has been determined .  an energy solution and a more exact
solution, both based on a plastic stress-strain relationship given
by the simple deformation theory, are presented .  close
agreement between the two solutions is found .  the effects of large
deflections and imperfections on buckling strength are analyzed .
for two groups of experimental results used for comparison, the
effects of geometrical imperfections in the plastic range are
negligible .  the theoretical results are found to be in good
agreement with the experimental results .
