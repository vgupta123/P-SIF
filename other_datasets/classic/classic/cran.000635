heat transfer and pressure distributions on a hemisphere-cylinder and a
bluff-afterbody model
in methane-air combustion products and in air .
an experimental investigation has been made to indicate the validity of
using methane-air combustion products as the test medium for aerodynamic
heating and loading tests .  tests were conducted on a
hemisphere-cylinder and on a bluff-afterbody model, both in methane-air combustion
products and in air alone, and covered a range of mach numbers from 6 to
the data showed that the nondimensional heating-rate distribution
along a hemisphere-cylinder as obtained in combustion products was in
good agreement with that obtained in air, and the results were in
reasonable agreement with theory .  the stagnation-point heating rates
in air and in combustion products over the hemisphere-cylinder agreed
within 10 percent of the theoretical values .  the pressure
distributions around a hemisphere-cylinder obtained from tests in combution
products were in good agreement with those obtained in air and could
be predicted by newtonian flow theory .  the tests in combustion
products of a bluff-afterbody model produced nondimensional
heat-transfer coefficients which were in fair agreement with results
obtained in air .
