Retrieval of Answer-Providing Documents
   (I) Better understanding of subject document retrieval might result if 
different functions of subject document retrieval system are studied 
separately.. This paper is concerned with retrieval of documents, in response 
to a question, from which answers to that question can be inferred 
("answer-providing documents").. "Answer can be inferred from document" has 
many possible meanings, one of which must be selected (an "inference 
specification").. Inasmuch as scientists in a field disagree about the 
correctness of inferences, have somewhat different background knowledge, etc., 
any inference specification can only approximate scientific inference 
practices.. Two sources of systematic knowledge of document-statement inference 
practices in a scientific field are described.. (II) If a content word occurs 
in a question, then it occurs in any answer to that question (with some 
apparently tractable exceptions).. An indexing procedure based on that fact is
described which would permit retrieval of all answer-providing documents for a 
question.. However, because the indexing is "nonrelational", it could cause 
false retrievals as well.. Various ways of dealing with such false retrievals 
are   briefly indicated, and a study is sketched that would provide data for 
helping selection among them.. Two special point concerning indexing for 
retrieval of answer-providing documents are discussed separately..
