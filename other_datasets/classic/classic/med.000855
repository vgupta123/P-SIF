actinomycin and erythropoiesis and the production of erythropoietin in
mice.
in b6d2f female mice a single dose of 10
of actinomycin will suppress normal
erythropoiesis (fe erythrocyte uptake).  in
polycythemic mice 2 is enough to
prevent the stimulatory effect of 0.25 a units
of erythropoietin.  the curves of suppression
and recovery versus time support the
hypothesis that erythropoietin acts
for a short time in an early stage of
erythropoiesis; after this early stage developing
cells are no longer so sensitive to actinomycin.
recovery, even from repeated
doses, is rapid and adequate.  amounts of
actinomycin which are adequate to abolish
erythropoiesis do not prevent the new appearance
of erythropoietin in the plasma of
hypoxic mice.
