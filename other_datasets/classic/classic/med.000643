a method for direct demonstration of pleuropneumonia-like
organisms in cultured cells.
direct microscopic observation
of pleuropneumonia-like organisms (pplo)
in cell cultures is easily accomplished follow-
ing hypotonic treatment, air-drying and
staining with orcein.  a rapid technique using
fl human amnion cells, inoculated with su-
pernatant from suspected cultures, is de-
scribed.  the demonstration of pplo con-
tamination of 30 cell lines by this rapid
method was in complete agreement with re-
sults of pplo-agar techniques.
