on convective motion of a conducting fluid between
parallel vertical plates in a magnetic field .
  stationary convective motion of a conducting fluid
between vertical parallel plates in a
magnetic field is considered .  an exact solution of the
magnetohydrodynamic equations is
obtained for the case of a constant vertical temperature
gradient .  the critical value of
grasshof's number is determined for the case when the
temperature of both plates is the same .
