An Analysis of Inline Substitution for a Structured Programming Language
An optimization technique known as inline substitution
is analyzed.  The optimization consists 
of replacing a procedure invocation by a modified copy
of the procedure body.  The general problem of 
using inline substitution to minimize execution time
subject to size constrain ts is formulated, and an 
approximate algorithmic solution is proposed.  The algorithm
depends on run-time statistics about the 
program to be optimized.  Preliminary results for the
CLU structured programming language indicate that, 
in programs with a low degree of recursion, over 90
percent of all procedure calls can be eliminated, 
with little increase in the size of compiled code and a
small savings in execution time.  Other conclusions 
based on these results are also presented.
