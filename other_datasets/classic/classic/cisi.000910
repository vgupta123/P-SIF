Libraries and Neighborhood Information Centers
  It has been suggested by various librarians concerned with inner-city
service that the library serve as an informational and interpersonal link
between community residents and social agencies.  The major question is
whether it is necessary to add another agency to the already overburdened
social service bureaucracy.  The rationale for envisioning the library in
this role is twofold:  (1) the library has achieved a reputation for
impartiality because it provides information on all sides of an issue and
is not committed to any particular action program, community service or
clientele; and (2) librarians are specifically trained to locate, organize,
update and disseminate information.
