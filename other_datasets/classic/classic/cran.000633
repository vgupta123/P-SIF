an extension of the method of generalised conical flows
for lifting wings in supersonic flow .
  the method of generalised conical
flows has previously been developed
subject to the condition that the
upwash divided by the streamwise
co-ordinate to the power k, where
k is the order of the conical flow, must
have vanishing (k+1)th derivative
with respect to the conical co-ordinate .
  in the present note this restriction is removed .
  the results are also used to
discuss the effect of the application of
the leading edge attachment condition
on the wing pressure and geometry .
