the ph 6 antigen in strains of pasteurella pseudotuberculosis
and its relation to biological activities
it may be concluded that only part of the
p. pseudotuberculosis strains can synthesize the ph
6 antigen, whereas this property seems to be
shared by all the strains of p. pestis.  as in the
case of p. pestis, three kinds of biological activi-
ties were related to the presence of the ph 6
antigen isolated from a strain of p. pseudotubercu-
losis.
