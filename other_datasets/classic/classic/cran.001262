an extension of the linearized characteristics method
for calculating the supersonic flow around elliptic
cones .
  the method of linearized characteristics as applied by ferri to
the flow about elliptic cones can be used to determine the surface
pressure distribution, even when only linear terms are kept in the
boundary conditions, provided an area rule requirement is
satisfied .  in addition, the method can be applied for angles of attack
provided the elliptic body geometry is specified in a manner that
does not distort the cross section .  the surface pressure
distribution obtained by this modified method is in reasonable
agreement with experiment over the range of mach numbers and
semidiameter ratios considered .  experimental results for several
conical bodies are presented .
