Encyclopedia of Information Systems and Services
  The processing and transfer of information is an important activity of many
thousands of libraries, research institutes, educational institutions,
professional and trade associations, non-profit organizations, publishing
houses, government agencies, and others.  All of these groups are already
listed in a variety of existing directories.  This publication, on the other
hand, has selected from the above groups, those organizations and services
which are principally concerned with storage, retrieval, and dissemination
of information, and in addition, are innovative, experimental, or non-
conventional.  A major emphasis is on computerization, micrographics, networks,
advanced reference services, information centers, and data banks.
