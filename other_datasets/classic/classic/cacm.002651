The Treatment of Data Types in EL1
In constructing a general purpose programming
language, a key issue is providing a sufficient 
set of data types and associated operations in a manner
that permits both natural problem-oriented notation 
and efficient implementation.  The EL1 language contains
a number of features specifically designed to 
simultaneously satisfy both requirements.  The resulting
treatment of data types includes provision for 
programmer-defined data types data types and generic
routines, programmer control over type conversion, 
and very flexible data type behavior, in a context that
allows efficient compiled code and compact data 
representation.
