a new series for calculation of steady laminar boundary
layer flows .
  a new and general method for solving
problems of plane and steady laminar
boundary layer flows in incompressible
fluids with arbitrary outer pressure
distribution is developed .  this method
is based on the introduction of the
dimensionless quantities
as new independent spatial variables .
ordinates, u(x) the given outer velocity
distribution, v the kinematic viscosity .)
the solution of the boundary layer problem
is then given as a power series in e
with coefficient functions depending on n .
this series is a formally exact solution
of the boundary layer problem .
  the new series solution has the following qualities ..
      have the significance only of cartesian
      coordinates, the influence of wall
      curvature being neglected in boundary
      layer theory, the new coordinates
      are adjusted to the data of the special
      problem in any case of application .
      the new variables represent a logical
      development of former efforts in
      the field of boundary-layer flow calculation .
      with other series solutions known for
      some special cases is that the leading
      term of the new series satisfies
      exactly the outer boundary condition
      at all cross-sections along the wall .
      therefore, the succeeding terms give
      corrections only in the inner part of
      the boundary layer .  accordingly,
      taking also no. 1 into account, the zero
      order term by itself gives a good
      approximation for the boundary layer flow .
