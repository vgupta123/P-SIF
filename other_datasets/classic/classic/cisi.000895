Design Equations for Retrieval System Based on the Swets Model
   Swets's theory of information retrieval allows the threads of document
weighting formulae, probabilistic measures of effectiveness, and management 
theory to be woven into a coherent pattern.. Benefits of the theory are the
beginnings of a quantitative description of retrieval languages, a clear 
distinction between retrieval 'systems' and 'language', a recognition that 
retrieval performance can be tailored to suit individual needs in a systematic 
way, and confirmation that question Generality is a pivotal feature of the 
retrieval process.. The hypotheses involved are still in need of rigorous 
experimental testing..
