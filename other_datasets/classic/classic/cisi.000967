On Improving Communication among Scientists
  Libraries and information services of the twenty-first century almost 
certainly will be the beneficiary, or perhaps the victim, of enormous 
technological change. High-speed search by computers, microrecording 
techniques, remote interrogation consoles, and great communication networks
will someday place the world's knowledge at our fingertips.  It is inferred
by many that, through such a metamorphosis, we shall cure the
information ills of our age, bring order out of chaos, and somehow contain the
"information explosion" - or at least reduce it to a small conflagration.
