Teaching with MARC Tapes
   A computer based laboratory for library science students to use in class 
assignments and for independent projects has been developed and used for one 
year at Syracuse University.. MARC Pilot Project tapes formed the data base.. 
Different computer programs and various samples of the MARC file (48,000 
records, approx.) were used for search and retrieval operations..  Data bases,
programs, and seven different class assignments are described and evaluated for 
their impact on library education in general and individual students and faculty
in particular..
