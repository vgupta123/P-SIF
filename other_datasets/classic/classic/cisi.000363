Dynamic Information and Library Processing
  Among the various information processing tasks which may be carried
out with computing equipment, a special class exists for which the term
information takes on the literal and direct sense of recorded knowledge, or
intelligence.  The elements being transformed are then no longer restricted
to mathematical symbols alone, but they may be words and phrases, books,
documents, pictures, and other information carriers.  It is that more
restricted interpretation of an information process which gives rise to the 
field of information science, concerned with the collection, analysis,
classification, storage, retrieval, transmission, and dissemination of
recorded data and intelligence.
