A Model for Automating File and Program Design in Business Application Systems
This paper discusses a model for finding an efficient implementation of a 
business application system whose logical specifications have been determined
in advance.  The model views file and program design as a problem
of systematically coordinating the configurations of datasets and
computations.  It uses a straight forward search technique to
determine aggregations of computations, aggregations of datasets, device,
organization, and key order for each data set, key order for
 each computation, and access method  for each dataset-computation
pair.  Although computational results are presented for a sample
problem involving 54 computations and 49 datasets, the main point of
the paper is that the underlying model works computationally an
d is simple enough to be adapted to many file design situations.
