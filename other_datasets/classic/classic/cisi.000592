Some Remarks on Elitism in Information and the
Invisible College Phenomenon in Science
  Let me remind you of that famous place in Dickins'
Pickwick Papers where we hear of a researcher who
composed a copious review on Chinese Metaphysics with
the aid only of the Encyclopedia Britannica, which
contained absolutely no information on that subject.
The technique used, we are told with a nudge of
superiority, was to read for metaphysics under the
letter M, and for China under the letter C, and to
combine the information.
  I feel that we may be performing just such a miracle
of creative juxtaposition when we assume that Scientific
Information is just some special variety of information
that contains queer words like Potassium Permanganate,
pi r squared, and numbers like 2.71828.  We suppose too
that Scientific Libraries are just libraries that happen to be
full of scientific books, and that the best possible
technical librarian would be somebody who had picked up a
library qualification and combined it with the appropriate
sort of technical qualification.  There is, as they used to
say, no mixture of ingredients but a genuine chemical
compound.  I wish to point out two simple facts:  there is
more to scholarship than the mere cumulation, storage 
and retrieval of information, and there is about science
and technology something intrinsically different from
mere scholarship.
