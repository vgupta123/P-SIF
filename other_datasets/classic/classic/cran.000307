an approximate solution of hypersonic laminar boundary
layer equations and its application .
  approximate formulae of the displacement thickness and the skin
friction of the hypersonic laminar boundary layer are derived by use of
von karman's integral method, assuming the heat-insulated wall, the
prandtl number of unity and chapman and rubesin's formula for the
variation of viscosity with temperature .
the results obtained are
compared with some exact solutions .
because of the good agreement, it
seems that these formulae are very useful .
  these formulae, together with the tangent-wedge-approximation, are
applied to the viscous flow over
slender bodies with a sufficiently sharp
leading edge .  as an example, the
pressure distribution over a flat plate
is calculated numerically over the
entire region of the surface .
comparison with other author's theoretical
results as well as experimental
values is made .
