solution of subsonic nonplanar lifting surface problems
by means of high-speed digital computers .
  the method proposed in this paper is based on an approximate
solution of the integral equation which represents the potential
flow about a finite wing, with no restrictions beyond those
necessary for linearization .  after assuming the usual series
representation of the wing surface vorticity distribution, the solution
is achieved by approximating portions of the kernels of the
transformed integral equation by single and double fourier series and
performing termwise integrations analytically .  this is followed
by the routine inversion of the aerodynamic influence coefficient
matrix, after satisfying appropriate boundary conditions at
selected control points .  in this procedure the number of control
point used is limited only by the storage capacity of the
computer .  control points may be located so as to cover the entire
wing surface, with due regard to certain physical requirements,
permitting the accurate representation of complicated mean
surface shapes .
  an evaluation of the proposed method is included .
comparisons with other theoretical methods and electrical analogy tank
results are used to substantiate the accuracy of the proposed
method when applied to plane wings .  a final evaluation
involves a comparison of calculated surface pressure distribution
with wind-tunnel measurements on a swept, tapered wing with
a cambered and twisted mean surface .  the agreement evidenced
in the latter comparison has the same order of overall accuracy as
similar comparisons on plane wing planforms .  in either case,
the results given by the proposed method are within the accuracy
requirements for most aircraft design studies .
