two dimensional transonic unsteady flow with shock
waves .
  a study is made of the unsteady flow around an
airfoil at transonic mach numbers, the situation being
such that local supersonic regions terminated by
shock-waves are present in the vicinity of the airfoil .  for
the unsteady part of the flow, small perturbations
technique is employed and the interaction with the shock
wave is taken into account .  the case of an oscillating
aileron is considered first, and a solution is derived
for the pressure distribution on the aileron .  it is
found that the solution has a simple form when the
shock-wave is well ahead of the hinge axis of the
aileron .  as the shock approaches the hinge-axis a
correction must be added to the solution .  an
interpretation of these results is given .  the results are
compared with results of a theory which neglects the
presence of the shock and it is found that both agree
for m = 1 .  for m   1, however, neglecting the presence
of the shock waves introduces errors of the order of
magnitude (1 - m), where m is the local mach number
behind the shock .
  the theory is finally extended to include the case
in which the whole airfoil oscillates, but only the
solution for the subsonic region behind the shock is
treated .  the role of the unsteady shock-boundary layer
interaction is discussed and it is shown that this
mechanism can be included in the results of the present
theory .
