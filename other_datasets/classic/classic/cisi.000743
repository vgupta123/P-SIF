A Survey of the Use of On-Line Computer-Based Scientific Search Services
by Academic Libraries
   To explore their use of on-line computer-based bibliographic search services,
a one-page questionnaire was sent to 100 academic libraries in the United 
States having separate departmental chemistry or science libraries.. An attempt
was made to determine the background training of the persons performing the
searches, who the end users were, the growth trend, the funding, the data
bases used, and the value to the users.. Of the 73 replies, 49.3% indicated use
of such services, while 24.6% were planning to use them primarily by faculty
and graduate students.. Of those reporting, 83.3% used searchers with a 
background in library or information science; 47.2% had a background in 
scientific discipline..Two or more on-line services were used by 72.2%.. A 
majority of respondents stated that the use paid all expenses or a portion of 
the expenses.. The searches met the needs of the use most of the time in 83.3% 
of the cases, and all of the time in 5.4%..
