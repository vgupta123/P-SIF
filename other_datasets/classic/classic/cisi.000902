Language and Mind
  The three chapters of this book are somewhat elaborated versions of
three lectures, the Beckman lectures, that I delivered at the University
of California, at Berkeley, in January 1967.  The first is an attempt to
evaluate past contributions to the study of mind that have been been based
on research and speculation regarding the nature of language.  The second is
devoted to contemporary developments in linguistics that have a bearing on
the study of the mind.  The third is a highly speculative discussion of
directions that the study of language and mind might take in coming years.
The three lectures, then, are concerned with the past, the present, and
the future.
