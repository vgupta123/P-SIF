Current approaches to classification and clump-finding at the Cambridge
Language Research Unit
   Computer programs for automatic classification are a desideratum in many 
fields.. Work on suitable procedures for handling large bodies of object/
property descriptions has been in progress at the Cambridge Language Research
Unit for some years: this paper describes the current series of general-purpose
programs which have been developed there, in which classes or "clamps" of
objects are obtained, using a similarity matrix, by a simple iterative scan of 
the universe of objects, distributing them in such a way that an appropriate 
cohesion function is minimized.. This actual clump-finding process is embedded
in a overall package in which the information given by a classification is 
manipulated in a variety of ways.. The current applications of the programs, 
especially for information retrieval, are described..
