stagnation-point shock detachment of blunt bodies in
supersonic flow .
  presentation of stagnation-point shock-detachment distances
determined by the exact numerical method of gravalos, edelfelt,
and emmons .  the results are compared with those from the
previously published methods of van dyke and gordon, li and geiger,
and serbin, and with experimental data .
