PM, A System for Polynomial Manipulation
PM is an IBM 7094 program system for formal manipulation
of polynomials in any number of variables, 
with integral coefficients unrestricted in size.  Some
of the formal operations which can be performed 
by the system are sums, differences, products, quotients,
derivatives, substitutions and greater common 
divisors.  PM is based on the REFCO III list processing
system, which is described and compared with 
the LISP and SLIP systems.  The PM subroutines for arithmetic
of large integers are described as constituting 
an independently useful subsystem.  PM is compared with
the ALPAK system in several respects, including 
the choice of canonical forms for polynomials.  A new
algorithm for polynomial greatest common divisor 
calculation is mentioned, and exaples are
included to illustrate its superiority.
