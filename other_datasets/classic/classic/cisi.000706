A Graph-Theoretic Algorithm for Matching Chemical Structures
  There are many chemical retrieval systems which
process the first type of request efficiently.  Most of these
systems are also capable of handling certain fragment
requests; however, the fragments which can be processed
are frequently of a restricted nature.  For example, in
retrieval systems which are based on linear ciphers, only
those fragments which are explicit in the cipher are
readily detected.  To allow a completely general 
specification of fragments it seems inevitable that a
detailed atom-by-atom comparison is required of the query
and library structures.  A technique for making such detailed
comparisons is presented in this report.  This technique
is novel in that it avoids the excessive backtracking ad
restarting required by other atom-by-atom matching
procedures.
  Before giving the details of the proposed algorithm,
some definitions are reviewed and a brief example is
presented to illustrate the over-all concepts.  Then the flow
diagram of the algorithm is explained in terms of additional
examples.  Finally, the mechanization of the algorithm for
a digital computer is discussed.
  This report is a condensed version of the original, which
gives a generalization and comprehensive description of
the algorithm, proofs of convergence and related topics,
and applications other than chemical retrieval systems.
