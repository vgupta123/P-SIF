Adventures in Theory of Languages
  In trying to give an account of the statistical properties of
language, one is faced with the problem of having to find the
common thread which would show the many and multifarious forms
of language statistics - embodied in scattered papers written
by linguists, philosophers, mathematicians, engineers, each using
his own professional idiom as belonging to one great whole:
quantitative linguistics.
  The book stresses the peculiarity of statistics of language
structure as against just conventional statistics.  To put the
difference between two types of statistics briefly, the latter comprises
the methods and parameters of general number statistics as applied, e.g., in
Economics and Demography, the former has its own methods and characterising
parameters, particularly useful for describing and evaluating language
structure.  The idea of statistical linguistics as using concepts and
methods of its own, which was adumbrated in the author's "Language as
choice and Chance", 1956, has now taken definite shape.
  Of this development I shall try to give a brief account.  In my book,
"Language as Choice and Chance", the foundation was laid for a truly
sensible application of statistics to language by my interpretation
of the langue-parole dichotomy as being essentially that between statistical
universe and sample.
