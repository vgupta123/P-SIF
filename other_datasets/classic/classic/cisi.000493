Experimental Use of a Program for Computer-Aided Subject-Index Production
   Stages in the development of a program for the production of articulated 
subject indexes are described.. The preparation of an index to the third 
edition of the SMRE Bibliography has enabled the technique to be assessed in a 
practical situation.. Titles from 1700 documents included in the bibliography 
were edited to provide input to the program, and the output recorded on a 
micro-film/hard-copy recorder in upper case alone..
   Further developments now in hand are indicated and criteria for assessing the 
suitability of the technique relative to other index-production techniques are 
discussed..
