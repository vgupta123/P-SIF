an approximate treatment of unsteady heat conduction
in semi-infinite solids with variable thermal properties .
  this very short paper presents an approximate procedure for the
calculation of unsteady heat conduction in semi-infinite solids
with variable thermal properties .  it is claimed to be an
improvement over previous efforts in this area since it yields physically
sensible results for cases where thermal properties have a large
dependence on temperature .  instead of using polynomials to
represent an unsteady temperature profile an exponential form is used .
good agreement is shown for several cases where the method of
the paper is compared with exact solutions .
