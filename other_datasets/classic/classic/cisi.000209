Survey of the Card Catalog in Medical Libraries
   A survey of present uses and arrangement of medical library card catalogs 
was made in order to determine current practices and trends.. Attention was
focused on the influences of MeSH on the card catalog.. The results indicate
that the prevalent type of card catalog found in medical libraries is the 
divided catalog.. In addition, it appears that this catalog arrangement is 
gaining acceptance, and the trend is toward division.. MeSH has an effect on 
the organization of the card catalog; libraries indicate that it is an 
influential factor in the decision to divide the catalog..
