The Multiterm Index:  A New Concept in Information Storage and Retrieval
  An index not only can be a creative communication
medium, it needs to be in a research and development
environment.  A creative index is achievable if the
relationship and association of things and actions,
one to another, can be communicated as a continuous
function vis-a-vis the real world of science and
technology.
  A chemist does not think of a chemical, for example,
ethyl alcohol, in isolation.  Ethyl alcohol is not merely
a word or a term without dimensions to a chemist.  It
is a concept that he associates with or relates to a
product, a reactant, a solvent in a reaction, a use, a
property, etc.  It is within the semantics of his
conceptual needs that he would like to use an index to 
retrieve those documents he needs.  He wants more than
documents, however, from the index.  He wants the index
to direct him to those documents which are pertinent
to his problem.  He wants the index to help him to
generate thoughts and to suggest new combinations.
He wants the index to help him in terms of his language,
logic, and semantics and through a generic or specific 
approach, whichever occurs to him first.  He wants the
ability to browse among the terms to discover the term
that is on the tip of his tongue or recessed in his
memory.  These are the criteria an index must satisfy
if it is to be a creative medium of communication.
