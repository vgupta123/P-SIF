Contemporary Problems In Technical Library and Information
Center Management:  A State of the Art 
  The Review Papers included in this volume represent one
of the valuable products of the American Society for Information
Science.  The original draft papers were sponsored
by the TISA (Technical Information Support Activities)
Project of the Army Corps of Engineers, as indicated on
the reverse title page.  The basic objective of this TISA
project was to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
Department of Defense (DoD) technical libraries, information
centers and information analysis centers.  The establishment
of priorities for TISA-sponsored research was undertaken 
by the Graduate Library School of the University of Indiana.
