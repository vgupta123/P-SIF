A Business Intelligence System
   An automatic system is being developed to disseminate information to the 
various sections of any industrial, scientific or government organization.. 
This intelligence system will utilize data-processing machines for auto-
abstracting and auto-encoding of documents and for creating interest profiles
for each of the "action points" in an organization.. Both incoming and 
internally generated documents are automatically abstracted, characterized by a
word pattern, and sent automatically to appropriate action points.. This paper
shows the flexibility of such a system in identifying known information, in
finding who needs to know it and in disseminating it efficiently either in 
abstract form or as a complete document..
