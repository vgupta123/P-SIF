The Community College Library
  This study deals with the learning resources programs of the public
two-year colleges.  In former years, these institutions were commonly
called junior colleges, and the college departments or divisions that
assembled, organized, and interpreted the learning resources (mainly
books) were commonly called libraries.  In keeping with traditional
terminology I could have chosen "The Junior College Library" as the
title for the study; however, I decided to modify the title to make it
correspond more closely to prevailing current terminology.
