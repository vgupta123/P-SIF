numerical construction of detached shock waves .
  this article proposes a new method for solving the problem
of the detached shock wave .  if the shock wave is assumed
known, a cauchy problem for a system of partial differential
equations arises .  this has been solved by several authors
in the region where the system is elliptic (near the peak of
the shock wave) .  considering the plane stationary case, the
author seeks an analytic continuation of the propagation
function (x,y) in the complex plane y = y1 + y2, x real .
in the plane (x, y2) the propagation function satisfies a
hyperbolic equation (near the peak of the shock wave) .  a
new cauchy problem is solved and the solution of the original
problem obtained by analytic continuation .  a numerical
example is treated with many details .
