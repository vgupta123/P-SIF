  This study undertakes to document the process and the thinking
that led Leyh to his controversial professional-political activities
and his widely criticized writings in his later years.  Every effort
has been made to present the documentary material and to analyze
Leyh's reactions to political and psychological pressures without
favoring any particular position.  Neither a justification nor a
critique of Leyh's actions is intended.
