One-Pass Compilation of Arithmetic Expressions for a Parallel Processor
Under the assumption that a processor may have
a multiplicity of arithmetic units, a compiler 
for such a processor should produce object code to take
advantage of possible parallelism of operation. 
 Most of the presently known compilation techniques
are inadequate for such a processor because they 
produce expression structures that must be evaluated serially.
 A technique is presented here for compiling 
arithmetic expressions into structures that can be
evaluated with a high degree of parallelism.  The 
algorithm is a variant of the so-called "top-down"
analysis technique, and requires only one pass of 
the input text.
