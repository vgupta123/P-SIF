A Proposal for Definitions in ALGOL
An extension to ALGOL is proposed for adding
new data types and operators to the language. 
 Definitions may occur in any block heading and terminate
with the block.  They are an integral part 
of the program and are not fixed in the language.  Even
the behavior of existing operators may be redefined. 
 The processing of text containing defined contexts features
a "replacement rule" that eliminates unnecessary 
iterations and temporary storage.  Examples of definition sets
are given for real and complex matrices, 
complex numbers, file processing, and list manipulation.
