Automated Acquisitions Procedures at the University of Michigan Library
  In June 1965, the Acquisitions Department of The University of
Michigan Library began using a computer-based system for ordering
books and other library materials.  This is the beginning of an over-all
automated system for the Acquisitions Department and was designed
with the assistance of Robert O. Kindt, Systems Analyst from the
University's Office of Management Services.  Preliminary work on the
automated system was begun in late 1963, and in September, 1964.  Mr.
Kindt was assigned to the University Library on a full-time basis.  After
the preliminary proposal was drafted, cost and feasibility studies were
made.  Current (i.e., 1964) volume and costs were compared with anticipated
volume and costs in 1968 and 1975 for both manual and automated systems.
