Evaluation of Information Systems and Services
  This chapter summarizes and discusses the present state of the art in
testing and evaluation.  Three tasks will be undertaken: to outline in
some detail the few substantive research projects involving testing and
evaluation, to describe a number of research projects in areas cognate to
testing and evaluation, and finally, to provide some general conclusions
with respect to past and future activity.  Although a distinction is made
in this review between laboratory-based experimentation and tests of
operational systems, the methodology used in each instance is substantially
the same.  As yet, no full-scale and elaborate field approach has been
attempted.
