on the testing of supersonic compressor cascades .
  to facilitate the development of high speed axial-flow compressors,
an investigation was made into the possibility of measuring blade
performance in a stationary cascade at supersonic speeds .  a suitable
technique was developed and the losses in a variety of cascades were
measured, but these losses were too high for the blading to have any
possible application .  it was concluded that if a useful compressor is
to result, it is essential to test the cascades at mach numbers close to
the existing technique was suitable only for zero incidence tests, and
thus a new approach is necessary .
  some of the fundamentals of this cascade testing at low supersonic
speeds are discussed in the light of the current understanding of the
mode of operation of supersonic compressors at transonic speeds .
