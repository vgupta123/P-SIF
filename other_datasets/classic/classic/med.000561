the dilution test as a measure of renal function in niobium-poisoned rats
control, female, albino rats given a water load of 50 ml/kg, excreted
50 per cent of this load as urine within 94  11 minutes (teu50).
the administration of a single intraperitoneal dose ranging from 10
to 30 mg nb/kg resulted in 2- to 4-fold increases in the teu50 value
24 hours after the niobium was injected.
when niobium was complexed with ascorbic acid prior to injection the
teu50 value was within control limits.  however, rats given a single
intraperitoneal dose of niobium and then given 3 doses of ascorbic acid at
intervals of 1, 3, and 6 hours showed teu50 values that were not markedly
different from those observed in rats given niobium only.
increased teu50 values were observed in rats given single intraperitoneal
doses of uranyl nitrate (1.2-2.4 mg u/kg), mercuric chloride (2.0 mg hg/kg)
and sodium tripolyphosphate (480 mg/kg).
