deafness
methods of detection, diagnosis, and management of deafness
in children depend so entirely on a knowledge of the processes
involved in communication by speech and in the acquisition of
this skill that i propose to consider them first.  it will be found
that the practical steps to be taken in dealing with patients flow
naturally from this knowledge.
