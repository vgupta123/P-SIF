integrals and integral equations in linearized wing theory .
the formulas of subsonic and supersonic wing theory for source, doublet,
 and vortex distributions are reviewed, and a systematic presentation is
 provided which relates these distributions to the pressure and to the
vertical induced velocity in the plane of the wing . it is shown that
care must be used in treating the singularities involved in the analysis
 and that the order of integration is not always reversible . concepts
suggested by the irreversibility of order of integration are shown to be
 useful in the inversion of singular integral equations when operational
 techniques are used . a number of examples are given to illustrate the
methods presented, attention being directed to supersonic flight
speeds .
