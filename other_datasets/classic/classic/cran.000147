supersonic flow past slender pointed wings with ?similar?
cross sections at zero lift .
  some recent theoretical work on slender pointed wings at zero lift is
co-ordinated and extended .  the wings
considered may have any pointed plan
form shape, provided that the trailing
edge is straight and unswept .  the root
section profile and cross-section shapes
are arbitrary, provided that, on any
one wing, the latter are /descriptively
similar/ (diamond or parabolic biconvex
for instance), though not necessarily
geometrically similar .  the chief aim of
the work is to find wings with simple
geometry, low wave drag and pressure
distributions which are unlikely to be
seriously affected by viscous effects .
wave drag and pressure distributions
are calculated by slender-wing theory .
general formulae, which are both simple
and instructive, are given for the wave
drag and the overall pressure distribution,
with particular emphasis on the root
pressure distribution .  results for a number
of wings of special interest are
presented and discussed .
