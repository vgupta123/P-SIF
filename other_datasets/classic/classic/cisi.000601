Some Implications of Automatic Recognition of Bibliographic Elements
   A theoretical approach to the problem of converting printed bibliographic 
records to machine readable form is developed based on principles of system

Library Research, University of California, are used to illustrate how this
theoretical approach is currently being tested prior to implementation in a 
large scale conversion project..
