Experiences of IIT Research Institute in Operating a Computerized Retrieval
System for Searching a Variety of Data Bases
   The Computer Search Center (CSC) at IIT Research Institute (IITRI) provides
information from computer-readable data bases to users in industry, government
and universities.. The center was designed to meet user needs by providing a 
variety of services from multiple data bases with minimal restrictions and a
high degree of flexibility.. A new modular machine-independent PL/1 software
system was developed for handling virtually any bibliographic-type base.. CSC
have run at nine different computer facilities with different: hardware,
computer models, versions of OS, peripherals of the PL/1 compiler.. All data
bases are converted by preprocessors to a standard IITRI format which employs
a directory and character string type of the structure..
   User oriented profile features include: full free form Boolean logic with 
any degree of nesting; search terms may be any data element on a data base; 
search terms may be single words, multi-word terms, phrases, or term fragments;
full truncation capabilities; optional sort of author, citation number, or 
weight; and optional printing of output on 5x8 cards, multilith masters, paper,
or tape.. User aids were developed for each data base to assist in profile and
monitoring.. They include: search manuals, truncation guides, term frequency 
list and KLIC indexes..
   Research is conducted and statistics maintained to study, monitor, and 
improve Center components including data bases, user satisfaction, systems,
personnel functions and services.. The many advantages of computerized 
retrieval, which are the raison d'etre for the center, include: coverage,
thoroughness, consistency, interdisciplinariness, recall, speed, regularity,
file preparation and cost effectiveness..
