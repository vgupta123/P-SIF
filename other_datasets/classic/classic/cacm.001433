A Note on Linear Programming Algorithm Design: A Combinatorial Problem
As linear programming models grow bigger and
bigger in size, much actual data that must be 
memorized is often put on magnetic tape or disk, and
consequently there is an improportionality fast 
rise in the consumption of computer time.To cut down
this expense, an ever increasing effort is made 
to design more efficient algorithms.  This paper is
meant to support the effort.  It is attempted to 
find some characteristics of the way a pivot column
is found.  The number of repetitions of a certain 
transfer of data from tape to core memory is considered.
 After some simplification, the problem is restated 
in a general way.  The generating function of the probability
distribution and the moment generating 
function of the number of repetitions is found.  Asymptotic
formulas are given for the moments using 
a result from a paper of S. Narumi [1].  The results
may be applied to write very efficient routines 
that search for an extreme value in a table.  Formulas
provide a means of calculating the computer timings 
in this case.
