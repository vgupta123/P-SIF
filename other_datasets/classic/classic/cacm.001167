On the Translation of Machine Language Programs
Automatic translation of machine language
programs is becoming a highly desirable goal with 
the advent of new large-scale computers.  The pitfalls that
make it difficult to achieve completely automatic 
translations are analyzed, and it is shown that these are
primarily of a semantic nature.  A semi-automatic 
procedure for resolving semantic problems is suggested.
