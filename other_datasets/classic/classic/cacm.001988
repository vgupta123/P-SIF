A Formalism for Translator Interactions
A formalism is presented for describing the actions
of processors for programming languages-compilers,
interpreters, assemblers-and their interactions in complex systems
such as compiler-compilers or extendible languages.
The formalism here might be used to define and answer such a
question as "Can one do bootstrapping using a meta-compiler 
whose metaphase is interpretive?"  In addition an algorithm
is presented for deciding whether or not a given system can
be produced from a given set of component processors.
