A Study of Current Awareness Publications in the Neurosciences
  Mailed questionnaires were used to study the use of two printed current
awareness devices in specialized areas of the neurosciences, one manually
prepared and the other a product of MEDLARS.  The study determined who
uses each publication, how much, for what purpose, and with what degree of
success.  A major purpose was to discover how valuable the publications are
to users and what impact they have had on their own research or professional
practice as well as on their information seeking behaviour.  Comparisons
are made between the results for the two publications.  Some conclusions are
drawn on information seeking behaviour in the neuroscience community and
on requirements for effective current awareness services in this field.
