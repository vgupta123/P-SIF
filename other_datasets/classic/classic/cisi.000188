An Investigation of the Educational Needs of Health Sciences Library
Manpower:
   IV. Characteristics of Manpower in Health Sciences Libraries
   A statistical description based on a mail survey of personnel in 2,099
health sciences libraries located outside of the hospital setting is reported..
Respondents to the survey were divided into three groups: professionals (those
possessing a graduate library degree); nonprofessionals (those not possessing
graduate library degree); and chief librarians (those responsible for a
library's operations).. Survey items dealt with education, sex, age, salary,
job mobility and preference for continuing education programs..
   Some 60 percent of the respondents were professionals; 40 percent were
nonprofessionals.. Seven hundred and twenty-eight chief librarians were 
identified in the population: 57 percent were professional librarians while
the remainder were without a graduate library degree.. Approximately 1/5
of all survey respondents were men.. The age distribution for the work force
tended to be bimodal, reflecting the career patterns of women and the later
entry of men into librarianship.. The annual salary for male professionals was
calculated at $12,732; for female professionals at $10,044; for male
nonprofessionals at $7,878; and for female nonprofessionals at $6,313.. Male
professionals were found to have the highest rates of job and geographic
mobility.. Conversely, female nonprofessionals were lowest in mobility.. In
expressing a preference for continuing education programs in library science,
professionals tended to request courses dealing with the organization of
libraries, health sciences institutions and their relationships, while 
nonprofessionals inclined towards courses in technical processing..
