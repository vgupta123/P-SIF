effect of abdominal operation on glucose tolerance and serum levels of
insulin, growth hormone, and hydrocortisone.
   abdominal operations of moderate severity are
followed by high fasting blood-glucose levels and a reduced
tolerance to intravenous glucose which persists
for at least 72 hours after operation.  fasting plasma-insulin
levels are raised after surgery.  intravenous glucose
produces much higher levels of serum-insulin and
growth hormone in the immediate postoperative period.
corticotrophin infusion increases the plasma-hydrocortisone
levels and reduces glucose assimilation to a
greater extent than operation, but has no effect on serum-insulin
or growth-hormone levels.
