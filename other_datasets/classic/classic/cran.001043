on transverse vibrations of thin, shallow elastic shells .
  a numerical analysis is given for the solution of the
general equations of thin shells of revolution subjected to
rotationally symmetric pressure and temperature
distributions .
  the basic differential equations are in a very general
form, which permits the geometry of the shells considered,
to be specified by discrete data points .
  the analysis determines elastic stresses, strains and
displacements for multi-layer and multi-sectional shells of
revolution .  surface loads, temperatures, thicknesses and
material properties may vary arbitrarily in the meridional
direction .  temperatures and material properties can also
vary through the thickness .
  the solution is obtained by direct computation using a
numerical method that employs two by two coefficient
matrices,. and hence avoids the problems of slow convergence .
the solution has been programmed in a semi-algebraic
language which can be used on most high speed computers .
comparisons of numerical solutions to known exact and
approximate solutions of the thin shell equations are made to
demonstrate the accuracy of this method .
