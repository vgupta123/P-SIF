static longitudinal stability characteristics of a blunted glider
re-entry configuration having 79.5degree sweepback and 45degree dihedral at
 a mach number of 6.2 and angles of attack up to 20degree .
an experimental investigation was conducted at a mach number of 6.2 to
determine the static longitudinal stability characteristics of a model
of a blunted glider reentry configuration having 79.5degree sweepback
and 45degree dihedral . the free-stream reynolds number for the
investigation was 3.0 x 10 based on the basic model length of 7.5 inches .
tests were made through an angle-of-attack range from 0degrees to
investigation showed that incorporating 10degree nose incidence in the
basic model resulted in a lower lift-curve slope, a lower lift-drag
ratio, a higher value of trim lift coefficient, and a decrease in static
 longitudinal stability . in comparison, the effect of extending the
configuration length and incorporating 10degrees and 20degrees boattail
angles resulted in smaller changes in the longitudinal stability
characteristics of the model .
