Comparative and International Librarianship; essays on themes and problems
  In this decade, professionals in the field of librarianship and the
information sciences will continue to be faced with most of the
problems that have haunted libraries for generations, problems that
can be best summed up as the attempt to reduce the anonymity of
information.  There will also be many new problems.  Some of these
are already becoming apparent, while others are still unknown.  But
librarians need not despair; the past record is clear.  Through the use
of sophisticated electronic machines, we have begun to master the
bibliographical control and retrieval of information, we have
improved the communication between librarians and the consumers
of information on a national and international basis, and we have
refined the many problems concerned with cataloging and classifying
information.  In addition, library education has been on the front
line in trying to educate people to understand the complexities of
organizing and disseminating information of all types.
