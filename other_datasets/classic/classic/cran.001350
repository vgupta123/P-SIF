effects of jet billowing on stability of missile-type
bodies at mach 3. 85 .
  the interference effects of a
billowing jet on the forces and
moments of two missile-type bodies
were investigated in the nasa lewis
2-by 2-foot mach 3.85 wind tunnel .
to simulate a rocket jet, pressurized
nitrogen was exhausted from an
annular sonic nozzle .
  the results indicate that for
both models the stability parameter
moment coefficient with angle of
attack) in the region of zero angle
of attack was favorably influenced
by the interference resulting from
separation due to jet billowing .
schlieren photographs are presented
that show the separation due to the
jet billowing at various pressure
ratios and angles of attack .
