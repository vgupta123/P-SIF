the solution of elastic plate problems by electrical analogies .
a dynamic-analogy method for the solution of elastic plate problems is
described in this paper .  the electrical circuits developed here can be
set-up and studied on an electric-analog computer .  problems involving
deflections under constant load, transient vibrations, or normal
modes can be solved in this way .  the method of applying boundary
conditions to plates with irregular edges is given, together with
a detailed description of the representation of the boundary conditions
for a rectangular variable-thickness plate .  solutions that have been
obtained on the cal tech electric-analog computer are presented for
the static deflections and normal modes of a rectangular cantilever
plate .
