flutter of a two dimensional simply supported buckled
panel with elastic restraint against edge displacement .
  the critical flutter speed is evaluated for a two-dimensional thin
buckled panel with one surface exposed to a supersonic airstream and the
other to still air at the same static pressure .  the panel is simply
supported along the leading and trailing edges by rigid edge members
separated by an elastic member represented by a compression spring .
the whole system is acted upon by a constant compressive force uniformly
distributed along the edge members .  the aerodynamic forces acting on
the deflected panel are found from two-dimensional /quasi-steady/
theory, valid for slow oscillations where the downwash velocity is small
compared with the speed of flow and provided that the mach number is
sufficiently greater than .  the elastic behaviour of the panel is given
by von karman's large deflection equations modified to cover initially
curved plates .  the solution of the equations is carried out by means
of galerkin's method, which has been shown to give valid results for
a panel with a non-zero bending rigidity .
  the influence of the midplane compressive force carried by the panel
itself, the initial buckle amplitude and the elastic restraint against
edge displacements is investigated, and curves are presented giving the
critical dynamic pressure ratio as a function of these variables .
