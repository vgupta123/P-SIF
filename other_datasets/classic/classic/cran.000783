a method for calculating the subsonic steady-state loading on an
airplane with a wing of arbitrary planform and stiffness .
a method for computing the steady-state span load distribution on an
elastic airplane wing for specified airplane weights and load factors is
 given . the method is based on a modification of the weissinger
l-method and applies at subcritical mach numbers . it includes the effects
 of external stores and fuselage on the spanwise loading .
modifications are outlined for treating tail-boom and tailless airplane
configurations and for calculating the divergence dynamic pressure of a
swept wing with a large external store . a method is also outlined for
reducing wind-tunnel data to obtain effective aerodynamic coefficients
which are free of model flexibility effects . the effects of mach number
 can readily be evaluated from the aerodynamic coefficients thus
obtained .
