the velocity distribution in the laminar boundary layer
between parallel streams .
  a method is given for obtaining the solution of the laminar boundary
layer equations for the steady flow of a stream of viscous
incompressible fluid over a parallel stream of different density and
viscosity .  an approximate solution is also obtained by means of the
momentum equation .  it is shown that the solutions depend only on the
ratio of the velocities of the two streams and on the product of the
corresponding density and viscosity ratios .  numerical results are
given, in the case where the lower fluid is at rest, for four values of
and also when for one non-zero value of the velocity ratio .
