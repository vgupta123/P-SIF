Remote, On-Line, Real-time Computer Diagnosis
of the Clinical Electrocardiogram
Presented in this paper is a brief report on
the hardware, software, system configuration and 
function of a system for the remote, online, real-time digital
computer diagnosis of clinical electrocardiograms. 
 It seems likely that efforts of this sort will lead
to a satisfactory solution to the problem of the 
automatic diagnosis of electrocardiograms.  Current
attempts by the authors to extend the diagnostic 
capabilities of the present system are particularly concerned
with increasing the fidelity of the adaptive 
matched filters, the development of three dimensional pattern analysis,
the analysis of parallel electrocardiographer-computer 
diagnostic interaction, and a study of the possibility
of introducing major, tree-like branching decisions 
early in the diagnostic process.
