Library Practice in Hospitals
  According to a National Hospital Panel Survey conducted by the American
Hospital Association in February 1970, 4,191 (72 percent) of the 5,820
community hospitals in the United States operated a library.  This percentage
falls to 60 when only hospitals of less than 100-bed capacity are considered
(1,990 libraries in 3,318 hospitals).  In the 4,191 libraries, one or more
full-time staff members were found in only 1,054 (25 percent).  In even
fewer, 928, was there supervision of the library by a professional librarian.
Clearly there is a massive job to be done if these libraries are to perform
properly their functions of health education and patient care.
  By "community hospital" we mean the nonfederal, short-term hospital
providing general and selected special services, the hospital located at some
distance from a large medical center and without teaching and research
programs, such as a nursing school or internships.  Though the librarians
of more sophisticated teaching institutions may well profit from the study
of this book, it is written primarily for an audience of untrained, probably
newly employed, individuals who find themselves supervising the hospital's
library and do not know where to begin.
