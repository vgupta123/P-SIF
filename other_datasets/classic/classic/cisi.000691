  A selected sample of 281 readers of the Journal of Organic Chemistry has been
interviewed personally to obtain data on their reading patterns of the November
1968 issue.  Approximately 35% of the individual subscribers to JOC had read
or looked through the journal within the first seven days of receipt.  The 
average reader claims to have read part or all of 14 articles out of the 81
available.  At least 75% of every one of the 81 articles was read, ranging
from a low of 0.7% to a high of 10.2%.  Structures or equations rated high as
a "noted" segment of an article.  In addition to data on amount of reading of
the issue, respondents were asked about amount of time spent reading, other
journals read, and journals subscribed to.  Correlations have been developed
between subject interest as stated by respondent and his actual reading pattern.
