method for design of pump impellers using a high speed
digital computer .
  a method of designing pump impellers
is derived from the equations of motion
and continuity for incompressible nonviscous
relative flow .  the flow is assumed
to follow a known stream surface (representing
blade shape) that extends from hub
to shroud .  equations are also derived for
approximate blade-surface velocities
and pressures .  a detailed numerical procedure
and block diagram are given for
use on a digital computer .  a numerical example
that illustrates limited use of
the method is presented and further uses are
indicated .
