Indivisible Colleges; Diffusion of Knowledge in Scientific Communities
  In the last two decades, dramatic increases in the
scope and volume of scientific research have occurred, as
may be illustrated by the fact that the amount of scientific
literature is doubling approximately every ten years (Price
1963).  For the scientist who needs to locate particular items
of scientific information and for the documentation specialist
who must make them readily available, the organization and
management of this huge and expanding store of information
is a serious problem.  Increasingly radical solutions are being
proposed.  For example, some experts would like to scrap
scientific journals and distribute their contents piecemeal.
Information retrieval and delivery systems are being developed
to enable scientists to locate information quickly and effectively.
