The UDC in its International Aspects
  Universal Decimal Classification - dying duck or live bird? - or some
such title - was suggested to me, but this is highly debatable, and there will
hardly be time for the duck-shooters to develop a concerted onslaught in the
half-hour or so allowed us for discussion.  Besides, I hope to be able to
convince you - if the BSI's fine efforts have not already done so - that the
UDC is by no means the dying duck - certainly not the dead duck - that some of
its severest critics seem to imagine.  Perhaps the bird has ceased to soar as
it once did in the times of Otlet, La Fontaine, Bradford and Donker Duyvis, but
that it is still viable in the turbulent air of current documentation may be
gauged from a recent FID inquiry aimed at obtaining figures for the
distribution of UDC editions and an approximate estimate of the number of
users throughout the world.
