Automation in Libraries
  My purpose in writing this book has been to try to give an understanding
of what automated systems can do in libraries today.  I have limited
myself strictly to those areas which are commonly termed "library
housekeeping" - the processes of book ordering and cataloguing,
periodicals accessioning and circulation control, whose purpose is to
make a library into an efficient machine for acquiring, storing, and
disseminating knowledge and information.  These are the processes
which can be automated here and now to improve the quality of
service which a library can give to its readers.  I hope that the
descriptions and explanations given here will be of assistance to librarians
in developing appropriate automated systems in their own libraries.
