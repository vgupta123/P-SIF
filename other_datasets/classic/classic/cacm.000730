MIRFAG: A Compiler Based on Standard
Mathematical Notation And Plain English
A pilot version of the compiler MIRFAG, now
in operation, is described.  The chief features 
of the system, which is intended for the solution of scientific
problems, are the presentation of mathematical 
formulas entirely in standard textbook notation.  The use
of plain English for organizational instructions, 
automatic error diagnosis indicating the actual location
of the error in the uncompiled program, and 
an attempt to minimize that fragmentation of the original
problem statement which is a normal feature 
of programming systems.
