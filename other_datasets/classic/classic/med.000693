diuretics in pediatric practice
clinical notes and comments
with the development of more and more
potent oral diuretics in recent years, these
drugs which were once looked upon as being
of only limited usefulness in pediatrics are
now receiving clinical application.  they per-
mit a new approach to the management of
edematous states.  that most of them can be
given orally is a significant advantage, par-
ticularly when coupled with their relative lack
of toxicity.  although the number of patients
in the pediatric age range who require these
agents is relatively small, they are valuable
adjuncts in the management of chronic renal
disease, refractory heart failure, and hyper-
tension.  this discussion reviews their pharma-
cology and clinical indications.
