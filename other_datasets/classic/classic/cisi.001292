Computer-Assisted Design of Complex Organic Synthesis
  This article is concerned with the general theory of chemical synthesis and
with the application of machine computation to the generation of chemical 
pathways for the synthesis of complicated organic molecules.  The basis for 
the approach which has been developed comes in large measure from the methods 
used by chemists in the solution of certain types of synthetic problems.
