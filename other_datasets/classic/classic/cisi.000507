A Multidisciplinary and Computerized SDI Service for Industry and 
Research-Practical Experience and Costs
   In this paper the experiences, costs, price policy, market, sales promotion
and foreign cooperation of a Danish documentation department are described in
relation to two databases, as follows: The COMPENDEX tapes are scanned in
Denmark, whereas the INSPEC tapes are scanned in Holland with the inclusion of
Danish profiles according to a bilateral agreement.. The total costs in 
connection with COMPENDEX are evaluated and divided into four main components:
Disbursement to the supplier of the tape system, working expenses of the 
documentation center, costs of the electronic data processing, and expenses
connected with the procurement of the original material to the subscribers..
They can choose between including or deleting the COMPENDEX abstracts during
sequential text scanning and printing-out.. Search profiles are formed by the 
terms (word, author, journal code) connected by AND/OR/NOT-logic and weight
factors.. (The above documentation department belongs to the National 
Technological Library of Denmark and also two SDI services based on tape 
systems from CAS.. Retrospective searches have been carried out)..
