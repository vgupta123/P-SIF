AXLE: An Axiomatic Language for String Transformations
AXLE is a language designed for data manipulation.
 Data arranged in a linear form in a workspace 
is transformed according to a table of axioms, called imperatives.
 A transformation consists of a matching 
procedure, which decides where an imperative is applicable,
and a replacement procedure that modifies 
that part of the workspace.  Imperatives are applied
in accordance with definitions of symbolic terms, 
presented systematically in an assertion table.  The
process of definition includes the special case 
of recursive assertions.  Several complete programs
of imperatives are given to show a few applications
of the language.
