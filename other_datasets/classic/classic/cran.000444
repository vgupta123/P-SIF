an approach to the flutter problem in real fluids .
  an approximate theory of airfoils in unsteady motion in a viscous
fluid is proposed, in which viscous effects are accounted for by
relaxing the kutta condition and replacing it by a relation derived from
experiments in steady flow .  applications here, are limited to moderate
viscous effects below the stall .  the possibility of one-degree-
of-freedom flutter is discussed under this assumption .  the discussion is
partly extrapolated to the domain of stall flutter .  some possibilities
of further development of this theory for the stalled case are
indicated .
