a correlation of airfoil section data with the aerodynamic
loads measured on a 45 sweptback wing at subsonic mach
numbers .
  an investigation has been made of the possibility of correlating
airfoil section data with measured pressure distributions over a 45
sweptback wing in the mach number range from 0.50 to 0.95 at a
free-stream reynolds number of approximately 2 million .
the wing had an aspect ratio
of 5.5, a taper ratio of 0.53, naca 64a010 sections normal to the
quarterchord line, and was mounted on a slender body of revolution .
  at mach numbers of 0.85 and below, and for wing normal-force
coefficients below the maximum normal-force coefficient for an
infinite-aspect-ratio wing yawed 45 to the flow (derived from airfoil section
data by simple sweep relations), good correlation was obtained over most
of the wing between wing-section and two-dimensional-airfoil pressure
distributions .  for greater normal-force coefficients lateral
boundary-layer flow permitted the inboard wing sections to rise to high maximum
section normal-force coefficients .  the effectiveness of this lateral
boundary-layer flow disappeared towards the tip .  for all mach numbers,
the influence of plan-form effects on the pressure distributions limited
the quality of the correlation at the 20- and 95-percent-semispan
stations .  above a mach number of about 0.85 the shock waves
originating at the juncture of the body and the wing trailing edge spread over
the span, preventing further application of two-dimensional data .
  the spanwise load distributions at moderate normal-force coefficients
could be predicted from span-loading theory for the entire mach number
range of the tests .
