note on creep buckling of columns .
  forty-three cylinders of 40-inch
length and 16-inch diameter, made
of 5052-0 aluminum-alloy sheets of
thickness, were subjected to bending
moments constant along the cylinder
and in time in an oven which maintained
a constant temperature of 500 f
during the test .  all the cylinders
failed by buckling .  the time that
elapsed between load application and
collapse was measured .
