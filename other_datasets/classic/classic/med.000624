interpretation within the metaphor
analytic investigation of the use of the metaphor was first given impetus
by ella freeman sharpe (1950), who explored the symbolic
meaning of particular metaphoric phrases with reference to the body
and libidinal needs.  currently, interest has become focused upon the
use of the metaphor as a self-conscious, rational therapeutic technique
of communication, of particular value with those patients who have
reached "the borderline of sanity".  ekstein (1961) and ekstein and
wallerstein (1957) have emphasized that the use of the metaphor
should be regarded as an essential technique for gradually establishing
communication and initial insight with borderline and schizophrenic
patients but that it must not be regarded as a treatment technique
in itself.  it is but a preliminary approximation to the final therapeutic
act, which ultimately will consist of a classical interpretation
at the level of the secondary process.  the use of the metaphor derives
its primary value from maintaining contact with patients who are
constantly in danger of being inundated by a break-through of primary-
process material.
