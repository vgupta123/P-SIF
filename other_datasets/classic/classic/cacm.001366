Computer Simulation-Discussion of the
Technique and Comparison of Languages 
The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison
of some computer simulation languages 
and of some of the involved in comparing software packages
for digital computers are discussed in Part 
I.  The issue is obvious: users of digital computers
must choose from available languages or write their 
own.  Substantial costs can occur, particularly in training,
implementation and computer time if an inappropriate 
language is chosen.More and more computer simulation
languages are being developed: comparisons and 
evaluations of existing languages are useful for designers
and implementers as well as users.  The second 
part is devoted to computer simulation and simulation
languages.  The computational characteristics of 
simulation are discussed with  special attention being
paid to a distinction between continuous and discrete 
change models.  Part III presents a detailed comparison
of six simulation languages and packages: SIMSCRIPT, 
CLP, CSL, GASP, CPSS and SOL.  The characteristics of
each are summarized in a series of tables.  The 
implications of this analysis for designers of languages,
for users, and for implementers are developed. 
 The conclusion of the paper is that the packages now
available for computer simulation offer features 
which none of the more general-purpose packages do and
that analysis of strengths and weaknesses of each 
suggests ways in which both current and future simulation
languages and packages can be improved.
