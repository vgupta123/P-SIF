Cost Accounting and Analysis for University Libraries
   The approach to library planning studies in this paper is the use of 
accounting models to measure library costs and implement program budgets.. A 
cost-flow model for a university library is developed and tested with 
historical data from the General Library at the University of California,
Berkeley.. Various comparisons of an exploratory nature are made of the unit 
costs and total costs for different parts of the Berkeley system..
