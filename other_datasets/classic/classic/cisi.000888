Serials Data Control:  Current Problems and Prospects
  This paper will describe three areas of current serials activity which are
of importance to conventional libraries.  I would like to do this in general
terms, eschewing details which only seem to serve to confuse.  The three
areas are:
  l. Standards.  What they are, what impact they can have, what influence
     they currently are having on serials processing.
  2. Standards Setting Projects. I will attempt to describe and/or define
     the almost incestuous intricacies of the National Serials Data Program
     (NSDP), the International Serials Data System (ISDS), and CONSER
     (CONversion of SERials).
  3. Code Revision Activities.  I will outline the influence that current
     standards and projects are having on code revision activities.
  My comments are to be considered within the context of conventional
libraries, primarily one wherein card catalogs still exist and manual processes
are the rule.
