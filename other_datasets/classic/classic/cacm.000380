Comparison of Iterative Methods for the Calculation of nth Roots
Three iterative methods for calculation of
nth roots (including one proposed by the author) 
are compared in two ways: (1) Theoretical convergence
estimates are given.  (2) A new macrocompiler which 
estimates machine running time is used to compare the
running time of the three methods for a variety 
of input data.
