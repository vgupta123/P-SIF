Illustrative Computer Programming for Libraries
  Illustrative Computer Programming is intended as
a graded workbook or text supplement containing
typical practical problems, suggested solutions, and
tried analyses which emphasize programming efficiency
and some of the major features of PL/I (Programming
Language/One).  As such, it can be used alone or in
combination with established PL/I textbooks such as
those listed in the Selected Bibliography.  Programmers
with knowledge of other languages will not be bothered
by excessive introductory material, while beginners can
learn much by looking at the solutions to the problems
and their accompanying analyses.
