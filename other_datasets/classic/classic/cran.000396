variational and lagrangian thermodynamics of thermal
convection-fundamental shortcomings of the heat transfer
coefficient .
  extension of previous analyses, indicating the possibility of
extending the thermodynamics of irreversible processes to systems
which are not in the vicinity of an equilibrium state and for which
onsager's relations are not verified .  this involves generalizations
beyond the narrow field of heat transfer and to principles of wider
range than those of current nonequilibrium thermodynamics .
