A Modified Newton Method for Polynomials
A modified Newton method for polynomials is
discussed.  It is assumed one has approximations 
for all the roots of the polynomial.  Three variations
are described.  If the roots are simple, it is 
shown that under appropriate conditions, two
of the variations are cubically convergent.
