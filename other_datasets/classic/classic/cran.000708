aerodynamic characteristics of two winged reentry vehicles at supersonic
 and hypersonic speeds .
tests were conducted at the langley research center on two winged
lifting hypersonic reentry glider configurations . performance, stability,
and control data are presented at mach numbers of 1.62 and 2.91 for
angles of attack up to 15degree and at mach numbers of 6.8 and 9.6 for
angles of attack up to 25degree .
