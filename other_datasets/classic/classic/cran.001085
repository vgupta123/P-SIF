note on the convergence of numerical solutions of the navier-stokes
equations .
a criterion is given for the convergence of numerical solutions of the
navier-stokes equations in two dimensions under steady conditions . the
criterion applies to all cases of steady viscous flow in two dimensions
and shows that if the local 'mesh reynolds number', based on the size of
 the mesh used in the solution, exceeds a certain fixed value, the
numerical solution will not converge .
