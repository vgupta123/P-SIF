on transition experiments at moderate supersonic speeds .
  studies of transition over a flat plate at mach number 1.76
were carried out using a hot-wire anemometer as one of the
principal tools .  the nature and measurements of free-stream
disturbances at supersonic speeds are analyzed .  the
experimental results are interpreted in the light of present overall
information on transition at supersonic speeds and conclusions as
to further fruitful experiments are drawn .
