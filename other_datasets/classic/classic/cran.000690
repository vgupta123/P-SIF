investigaion of the flow over a spiked-nose hemisphere
cylinder at a mach number of 6. 8.
  the shape and nature of the
flow over a spiked-nose
hemisphere-cylinder was studied in detail
at a nominal mach number of 6.8 and in a
reynolds number range (based on
diameter and stream conditions ahead of
the model) of 0.12 x 10 to 1.5 x 10 .
schlieren photographs showed
the effect of varying the spike length
and reynolds number upon the shape
of the separated boundary and upon the
location of transition .  the heat
transfer and pressure distribution over
the body were then correlated
with the location of the start of
separation, the location of
reattachment, and the location of the start of
transition .
