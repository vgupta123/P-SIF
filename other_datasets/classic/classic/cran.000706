in the theory of nonstationary flows about airfoils, the /indicial lift/
 function k /s/ of wagner and the /alternating lift/ function c /k/ of
theodorsen have fundamental significance . this paper reports on some
interesting relations of the nature of fourier transforms that exist
between these functions . general problems in transient flows about
airfoils may be given a unified broad treatment when these functions are
 employed . certain approximate results also are reported which are of
notable simplicity, and an analogy with transient electrical flows is
drawn .
