a simplified method of elastic stability analysis for
thin cylindrical shells .
  the equation for the equilibrium of cylindrical
shells introduced by donnell in naca report no. 479 to
find the critical stresses of cylinders in torsion is
applied to find critical stresses for cylinders with
simply supported edges under other loading conditions .
it is shown that by this method solutions may be obtained
very easily and the results in each case may be expressed
in terms of two nondimensional parameters, one dependent
on the critical stress and the other essentially
determined by the geometry of the cylinder .  the influence of
boundary conditions related to edge displacements in the
shell median surface is discussed .  the accuracy of the
solutions found is established by comparing them with
previous theoretical solutions and with test results .
  the solutions to a number of problems concerned with
buckling of cylinders with simply supported edges on the
basis of a unified viewpoint are presented in a convenient
form for practical use .
