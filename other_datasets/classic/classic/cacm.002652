Reduction of Compilation Costs Through Language Contraction
Programming languages tailored to particular
groups of users can often be constructed by removing
unwanted features from a general purpose language.  This
paper describes the use of simulation techniques 
to predict the savings in compilation cost achievable
by such an approach.  The results suggest a function 
which describes the effect of changes in the power of
a language on the compilation cost of an algorithm 
expressed in that language: when features not actually
used by the algorithm are removed from the language, 
the cost of compiling the algorithm decreases moderately,
but when features that are needed are removed, 
the compilation cost increases sharply.
