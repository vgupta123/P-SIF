Classification Practice in Britain.  Report on a survey of classification
opinion and practice in Great Britain, with particular reference to the Dewey
Decimal Classification
  The objectives of the Sub-Committee in starting their enquiries were
basically three-fold
     1) To gather a reasonable collection of statistics relating to the general
        practice of classification in this country.
     2) To gather information on th actual use of the Dewey Decimal
        Classification in this country.
     3) To provide a basis for the recommendations which are provided
        periodically for the Dewey Editorial Policy Committee from the
        Library Association Library Research Committee's Sub-Committee on
        Dewey Decimal Classification Revision.
To this end a questionnaire was sent out to over 1100 libraries of all types
throughout the country and after six months reminders sent to librarians
to ensure they had received them and that none had been overlooked.  The
result of this was very pleasing; 716 were returned, the vast majority 
completed correctly.  The actual figures of type and size of library are
given in the body of the report but no type of library is completely omitted
and a significant proportion of the larger libraries returned the 
questionnaire.
