pulmonary vascular changes complicating
ventriculovascular shunting for hydrocephalus
a patient is described in whom pulmonary hypertension and cor
pulmonale were noted 3 years after placement of a ventriculovascular
shunting apparatus for treatment of hypdrocephalus.  in addition,
the histologic sections of lung tissue obtained from 65 patients with hy-
drocephalus who died at various intervals following placement of a
ventriculovascular shunting apparatus were reviewed with regard to vas-
cular alterations.  a high incidence of "old" and "multiple" pulmonary
vascular lesions was found in this group compared to the incidence
in control subjects.  this difference can be attributed to the operative
procedure.  the lesions in postmortem material were not
widespread and did not suggest the diagnosis
of pulmonary hypertension on purely histologic grounds.
