the effect of joint position on the pressure
of intra-articular effusion
it is known that joints with symptomatic effusions are held spontaneously in
characteristic positions and that movement of these joints increases pain.  in
the study reported here, a correlation was made between the hydrostatic
pressure of a joint effusion and the joint's position.  the results indicate a
possible relationship between intra-articular pressure and pain.
