the effect of lift on entry corridor depth and guidance
requirements for the return lunar flight .
  corridors for manned vehicles are
defined consistent with requirements
for avoiding radiation exposure and for
limiting values of peak
deceleration .  use of lift increases the depth
of the entry corridor .  mid-course
guidance requirements appear to be critical
only for the flight-path angle .
increasing the energy of the transfer orbit
increases the required guidance
accuracy for the flight-path angle .
  corrective thrust applied essentially
parallel to the local horizontal
produces the maximum change in perigee
altitude for a given increment of
velocity .  energy required to effect a
given change in perigee altitude
varies inversely with range measured
from the center of the earth .
