  three methods of approximating the deflections and
moments occurring in a rectangular cantilever plate
subjected to uniform normal pressure over its entire surface
are presented in this paper .  the first is the application of
the well-known finite-difference procedure .  the second
and third are collocation methods, one based upon
polynomial solutions of the lagrange equation, the other
employing /mixed/ hyperbolic-trigonometric terms
satisfying this equation .  in the last two methods the boundary
conditions are satisfied exactly along the clamped edge and
at a finite number of points along the free edges of the plate .
the results obtained for the particular case of a cantilever
plate with uniform normal load indicate that the use of a
relatively small number of points in the collocation
method yields values of deflections and moments that are
in substantial agreement with those given by the
finite-difference procedure .  it cannot be concluded from these
results that the collocation method using the assumed
functions will give satisfactory results with fewer points
than the finite-difference method for cantilever plates with
loading different from the one investigated .
