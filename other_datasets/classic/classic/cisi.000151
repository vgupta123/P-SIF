Thesaurus Compilation Methods:  A Literature Review
  This review has been sponsored by the Office for Scientific
and Technical Information and the end product of the complete
research will be a thesaurus of management terms.  Parallel research
in the business management area and also supported by OSTI is being 
conducted by David Dews, Librarian of the Manchester Business School,
and K.D.C. Vernon, Librarian of the London Graduate School of
Business Studies.  As Mr. Vernon is at present engaged in the
construction of a faceted classification scheme for management,
this investigation has concentrated on the possibility of utilizing
faceted techniques to construct such a thesaurus.
  A study of existing information retrieval systems in the
management field has already been made, so a decision to adopt
some form of post-co-ordinate indexing was assumed.  Thus a comparative
study of other systems will not be attempted.  A decision has also
already been made that a controlled vocabulary, i.e. a thesaurus,
was eventually going to be developed despite the latest Cranfield
results that appear to provide evidence of the superiority of
natural language over controlled vocabularies.  This was primarily
because these results were restricted to tests on an aeronautical
collection, and it may well be that the natural language of this
discipline is in itself a fairly controlled one, which is
certainly not the case with the rather 'soft' language of
management.  This is borne out to some extent by Halkin, who
quotes relevance figures for coordinate indexing applied to organic
chemistry (55 percent), engineering (35 percent), and social
science (20 per cent).
  Machine methods of term generation as described by Ovchinnikov,
Mastermann and Luhn will not be considered, as there is no equipment
available to prepare thesauri on the lines these authors suggest.
