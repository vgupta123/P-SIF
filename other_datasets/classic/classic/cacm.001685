GAN, a System for Generating and Analyzing Activity Networks
GAN, a system for generating activity networks,
is designed to save time in the preparation 
of activity networks and to deal conveniently with network
programs.  A defining description of a programming 
language designed for generating activity network from
a set of standard networks is presented.  Also, 
a general idea of a language for performing calculations
on activity networks (scheduling activity networks) 
is given.
