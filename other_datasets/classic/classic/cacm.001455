TRAC, A Procedure-Describing Language for the Reactive Typewriter
A description of the TRAC (Text Reckoning
And Compiling) language and processing algorithm 
is given.  The TRAC language was developed as the basis
of a software package for the reactive typewriter. 
 In the TRAC language, one can write procedures for
accepting, naming and storing any character string 
from the typewriter; for modifying any string in any way;
for treating any string at any time as an executable 
procedure, or as a name, or as text; and for printing
out any string.  The TRAC language is based upon 
an extension and generalization to character strings
of the programming concept of the "macro."  Through 
the ability of TRAC to accept and store definitions of
procedures, the capabilities of the language can 
be indefinitely extended, and can deal with character
strings, integers and Boolean vector variables.
