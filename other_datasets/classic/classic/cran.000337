boundary layer transition with gas injection .
boundary layer transition with gas injection .
the mass-injection process has been proposed as a method
of cooling aerodynamic surfaces, and, since the amount of
coolant required to maintain practical wall temperatures is
considerably larger for turbulent than for laminar boundary layers,
knowledge of the effect of the cooling method on the transition
process is certainly important .  exploratory studies reported
here were conducted at mach number 3.7 to ascertain the
effects of gas injection on the stability of the laminar boundary
layer on a conical surface .
