Computer Filing of Index Bibliographic and Catalog Entries
  The need to establish a filing code for computer arrangement
has become increasingly apparent as more and more book
catalogs and indexes have been prepared mechanically.  Many
of the difficulties in manual filing, as shown in the A.L.A. Rules
for Filing Catalog Cards, become even more intricate to cope
with when computers are used.  Of course, if cost is not an
object, the theoretical potentialities for computer programming are
practically limitless.  However, modifications in rules and procedures
can make the alphabetic arranging or merging of index, catalog,
or bibliographic entries by computer more readily possible, and
these modifications are made in this proposed code for computer
filing of complex alphabetic entries.
