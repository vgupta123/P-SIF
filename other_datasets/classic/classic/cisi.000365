Economics of the Academic Libraries
  This volume represents what we believe to be as complete
and thorough an analysis as possible of the available economic
data on college and university libraries.  In the course
of our study, we have examined the data for comprehensiveness
and consistency; we have investigated their intertemporal
behavior, both as a basis for projection and as an
instrument for long-range planning; and we have constructed
a set of analytic interrelationships which permit us to derive
statistical estimates of the interrelations of some of the most
critical economic variables relating to library operations.  In
particular, in the course of this last step, we have provided
relationships explaining statistically the determination of
such variables as the size of libraries' budgets and the
magnitude of their professional staffs.
