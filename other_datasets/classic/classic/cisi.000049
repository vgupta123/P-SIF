Adaptive Information Dissemination
   Computer dissemination of information offers significant advantages over
manual dissemination because the computer can use strategies that are 
impractical and in some cases impossible for a human.. This paper describes
the Ames Laboratory Selective Dissemination of Information system with emphasis
on the effectiveness of user feedback.. The system will accept any document, 
abstract, keyword, etc., in a KWIC or Science Citation Index Source format..
User profiles consist of words or word clusters each with an initially 
assigned significance value.. These values are used in making the decision to
notify a user that he may be interested in a particular document.. According to
responses, the significance values are increased or decreased and quickly 
attain an equilibrium which accurately describes the user's interests.. The
system is economical compared to other existing SDI systems and human
intervention is negligible except for adding and deleting profile entries..
