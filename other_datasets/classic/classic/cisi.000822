A Cost Survey of Mechanized Information Systems
   In the course of the survey covered by this paper, cost data were collected
by visiting eighteen operational computer-based systems in Europe and the USA,
using a structured cost analysis scheme.. The sample included data-base 
producers and self-contained systems that both create, and provide services 
from, a data base..
   From the data obtained, unit costs have been derived for most operations, 
and the factors contributing to variations in the figures are discussed..
   Analysis of the data has shown that costs are affected more significantly by 
factors such as system management, salary variations, and productivity of staff,
than by technical factors such as depth of indexing, data preparation methods, 
or computer programming..
   The total operating budgets of most of the systems have also been analysed to
show the overall pattern of cost distribution, including overheads..
