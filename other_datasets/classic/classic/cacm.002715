Implementation of a Structured English Query Language
The relational model of data, the XRM Relational
Memory System, and the SEQUEL language have 
been covered in previous papers and are reviewed. 
SEQUEL is a relational data sublanguages intended 
for the ad hoc interactive problem solving by non-computer
specialists.  A version of SEQUEL that has 
been implemented in a prototype interpreter is described.
 The interpreter is designed to minimize the 
data accessing operations required to respond to an arbitrary
query.  The optimization algorithms designed 
for this purpose are described.
