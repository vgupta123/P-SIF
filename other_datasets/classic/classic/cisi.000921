CONSER
Cooperative Conversion of Serials Project
  The final report from the Association of Research Libraries' ad hoc Committee 
on Machine-Based Serials, written in January of this year, showed that of the 
86 libraries which participated in the  committee's survey of efforts in the 
area of machine-readable serials files, 64 had files containing a total of
1,723,568 titles.  Twenty-two libraries reported having no files and one library 
indicated that it was in the process of converting its file.  The cost of
converting these files is approximately $1,500,000, not to mention the 
utilization of an incredible amount of duplicate conversion effort.
