Computer Education in a Graduate School of Management
Several years of experience have led to the belief that the creative
design and evaluation of management information systems requires
a thorough understanding of the related computer technology.  Concepts
such as paging and priority interrupt systems can best be explained at the 
machine language level.  Any machine used for exposition
should fulfill several criteria.  It should: (1) raise as few
spurious issues as possible; (2) allow, without undue effort, the
solution of interesting problems; (3) be capable of exposing all
outstanding issues of significance, capable of exposing all outstanding
issues of significance, within the chosen machine; (4) be
seful for pursuing issues in great depth when appropriate; (5) not
be committed to the equipment provided by any manufacturer; (6) be able to 
provide the student with diagnostic aids to a great depth;
(7) allow the student ready access to the machine; (8) be capable
of extension to expose new issues as they come along.  We have
constructed a simulated machine and its associated software which
meets these criteria.  This system, called the PRISM system,
is documented by a primer and a reference manual.
