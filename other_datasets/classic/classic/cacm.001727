One Way of Estimating Frequencies of Jumps in a Program
For the segmentation of a program it is useful
to have a reasonable estimation of the values 
of S(ij), where S(ij) is the mean value of the number
of jumps from the i-th instruction on to the j-th 
instruction in the run time.  In the cases where the
S(ij) are estimated directly, the structure of the 
whole program must be generally taken into account;
therefore it is very difficult for the programmer 
and/or the translator to obtain a good estimation of
the S(ij).  It is easier to estimate not S(ij) but 
the quantities P(ij)=S(ij)*C(i)/SUM[S(ij), j=1,N], where
C(i) is an arbitrary positive constant for each 
i.  Although the P(ij) are, for each i, proportional to
S(ij), the estimation of P(ij) is easier, because 
we must estimate only the "probabilities" of events
where instruction i is executed after instruction 
I(i).  This estimation can often be done without considering
the structure of the whole program.  In 
the first part of the paper, using the theory of the
Markov chains, an algorithm for the computation 
of the S(ij) from the P(ij) is found, and some ways
of obtaining estimates of the P(ij) are given.  In 
the second part a variant of this algorithm is derived,
avoiding the necessity of computation involving 
large matrices.
