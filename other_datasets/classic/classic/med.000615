learning problems in children: ii. emotional aspects
at the last meeting we tried to deal with a general over-all approach
to the problem of learning, considering it not merely as a problem in
reading, but learning in general which begins at birth.
we hope to deal with this problem at a relatively high level and we
want to have the emotional problems dealt with in this manner rather
than in terms of diagnostic criteria.  the child with learning problems
should not be compartmentalized in terms of "organicity" and "nonorganicity".
the subject of this talk, then, is emotional issues in learning.
