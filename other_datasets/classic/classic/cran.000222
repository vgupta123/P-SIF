the flow over delta wings at low speeds with leading
edge separation .
  a low speed investigation of the flow over a 40 apex angle delta
wing with sharp leading edges has been made in order to ascertain
details of the flow in the viscous region near the leading edge of the
suction surface of the wing .  a physical picture of the flow was
obtained from the surface flow and a smoke
technique of flow visualization,
combined with detailed measurements of total
head, dynamic pressure, flow
directions and vortex core positions in the flow above the wing .
  surface pressure distributions were also measured and integrated
to give normal force coefficients .
  the results of this investigation were compared with those of other
experimental investigations and also with various theoretical results .
in particular, the normal force coefficients, vortex core positions and
attachment line positions were compared with the theoretical results of
mangler and smith, reference 19 .  it was found that ..
exist on the upper surface of the wing outboard of and below
the main vortices .  these secondary vortices are formed as a
result of separation of the boundary layers developing outboard
of the top surface attachment lines .
