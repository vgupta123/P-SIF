UDC User Profiles as Developed for a Computer-Based SDI Service 
in the Iron and Steel Industry
   Extension of the Selective Dissemination of Information system required the
adoption of computer-based techniques.. The indexing language adopted is UDC 
and it was necessary to construct user profiles based on the classification..
Profiles have been compiled for individual clients of the service, for works
within the British Steel Corporation, and for broad fields of activity within 
the iron and steel industry.. Use of the service has shown that UDC provides a 
satisfactory basis for profile compilation.. The majority of profiles so far 
constructed have relevance of over 95%, based on user assessment.. Possible 
future developments in the compilation of the profiles are considered..
