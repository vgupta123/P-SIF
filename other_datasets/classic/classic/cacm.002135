Rapid Computation of General Interpolation
Formulas and Mechanical Quadrature Rules
Let f have n continuous on a closed interval
[a,b] and let L be a linear functional.  The attempt 
is made to approximate L (f) with L (Q) where Q is a polynomial,
approximating f.  Algorithms are developed 
for rapid computation of L (Q) for a wide class of
selections of Q which includes the Lagrangian and 
Hermitian rules as special cases.
