one-dimensional transient heat conduction into a double-layer
slab subjected to a linear heat input for a small time
internal .
  analytic solutions are presented for the transient heat
conduction in composite slabs exposed at one surface to a
triangular heat rate .  this type of heating rate may occur, for
example, during aerodynamic heating .
