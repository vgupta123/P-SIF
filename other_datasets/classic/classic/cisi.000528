Customized User Services via Interactions with LEADERMART
   LEADERMART is a fully operational information retrieval system featuring 
on-line interactive service  to a wide variety of user groups in business,
industry, government, and universities.. With the availability of many
computer-readable bibliographic data bases, experience with users dictated the 
development of special-purpose information products based on a thorough 
understanding of individual client needs, and the delivery of such products in 
a customized form.. Each different application required a different package, 
with variations of both software and data base coverage.. These packages were
developed via suitable modification of modular system software to result in 
products tailored to user idiosyncracies..
   The paper describes problems associated with these repackaging procedures, 
and discusses the changes brought about by the introduction of an on-line, 
interactive retrieval service into the operating environment of users.. 
Implications for networking and resource-sharing, focusing upon 
cost-effectiveness and performance measures, are also discussed..
