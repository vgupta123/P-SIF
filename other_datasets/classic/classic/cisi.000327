Computer Handling of Chemical Structure Information
  Far-reaching changes in the patterns of communication in science
are at present in motion, which seem likely to have fundamental
effects on scientists's use of and access to existing knowledge.
These changes derive from the increasing involvement of computer
techniques in the publication, dissemination and retrieval of scientific
and technical information.  Many of the implications of the changes
are not yet clear.  Information-handling is rapidly changing from a
labour-intensive industry to a capital-intensive one, as soaring
man-power requirements reflect the increasing flow of information and
increasing demands for timeliness, accuracy, and improved access.
But the changes to be effected also have major social implications;
the reasons for publication and use of information are complex,
reflecting the factors of a sociological nature which are still 
imperfectly understood.  The rate at which innovations in information-
handling win acceptance from scientists is determined partly by their
appreciation of the greater flexibility which the novel methods offer,
but also by the sensitivity, on the part of the designers and operators
of information systems, to the needs and habits of users, and to their
perception of the usefulness of the newer methods.
