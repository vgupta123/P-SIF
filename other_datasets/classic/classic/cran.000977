concerning some solutions of the boundary layer equations
in hydrodynamics .
  the boundary-layer equations for
a steady two-dimensional motion
are solved for any given initial
velocity distribution (distribution along a
normal to the boundary wall,
downstream of which the motion is to be
calculated) .  this initial velocity
distribution is assumed expressible
as a polynomial in the distance from
the wall .  three cases are considered ..
first, when in the initial distribution
the velocity vanishes at the wall,
but its gradient along the normal
does not,. second, when the velocity in
the initial distribution does not
vanish at the wall,. and third, when both
the velocity and its normal gradient
vanish at the wall (as at a point
where the forward flow separates
from the boundary) .  the solution is
found as a power series in some
fractional power of the distance along
the wall, whose coefficients are
functions of the distance from the wall to
be found from ordinary differential
equations .  some progress is made
in the numerical calculation of
these coefficients, especially in the first
case .  the main object was to
find means for a step-by-step calculation
of the velocity field in a boundary
layer, and it is thought that such a
procedure may possibly be successful
even if laborious .  the same
mathematical method is used to calculate
the flow behind a flat plate along a
stream .  the results are shown in
curves in the original .
