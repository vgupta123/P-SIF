pressure distribution and force measurements on a vtol
tilting wing-propeller model . pt .ii, analysis of
results .
  this report presents in graphical
form the results presented in
reference 1 from pressure distribution and force
measurements on a half-wing model
of a twin-engined tilt-wing vtol configuration .
the profound influence of the
slipstream on these results is discussed in some
detail .
