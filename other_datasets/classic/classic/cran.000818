a quantitative comparison of flow and deformation theories
of plasticity .
  the stresses and displacements in a partly plastic,
infinitely long, hollow cylinder are obtained according to the
flow type of stress-strain law of prandtl-reuss and to the
deformation law of hencky .  in both cases the mises yield
condition is used and the compressibility of the material is
taken into account .  it is shown that under these
assumptions the two theories yield substantially the same
results for this particular problem, but that one theory or
the other may be preferable for computing purposes in
certain cases .  the results are compared with those of
other investigations in which different combinations of
stress-strain law, yield condition, compressibility, and end
loading were assumed .
