An Efficient Data Structure for the Simulation Event Set
Recently algorithms have been presented for the
realization of event scheduling routines suitable 
for general purpose discrete event simulation systems.
 Several exhibited a performance superior to that 
of commonly used simple linked list algorithms.  In this
paper a new event scheduling algorithm is presented 
which improves on two aspects of the best of the previously
published algorithms.  First, the new algorithm's 
performance is quite insensitive to skewed distributions,
and second, its worst-case complexity is O( 
n), where n is the number of events in the set.  Furthermore,
tests conducted to estimate the average 
complexity showed it to be nearly independent of n.
