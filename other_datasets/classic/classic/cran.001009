  charts of thermodynamic properties for equilibrium air are presented
with sufficient accuracy to permit the calculation of flow parameters in
hypersonic nozzles operating at stagnation temperatures up to 4,950 r
and pressures up to 1,000 atm .  flow parameters calculated from these
charts are presented for a series of stagnation temperatures between
use of these parameters, it is possible to calibrate a nozzle in the
conventional way .  a method is also presented from which the flow
parameters for conditions other than those chosen herein may be
calculated .  real-gas effects on the calculation of a hypersonic nozzle
contour are shown by an example calculation in which the nozzle contour
for mach number 12 was determined by including real-gas effects, and
this contour was compared with one calculated by ideal-gas
considerations .  also presented are the approximate limiting mach
numbers at which equilibrium air will just condense for various
combinations of stagnation temperatures and pressures .
