Selected Results From An Inquiry Into Testing of
Information Retrieval Systems 
   A variety of aspects related to testing of retrieval systems were
examined.. A model of a retrieval system, together with a set of measures
and a methodology for performance testing were developed.. In the main
experiment the effect on performance of the following variables
was tested:  sources of indexing, indexing languages, coding schemes,
question analyses, search strategies and formats of output.. In
addition, a series of separate experiments was carried out to investigate
the problems of controls in experimentation with IR systems.. The main
conclusions:  the human factor appears to be the main variable in all
components of an IR system; length of indexes affects performance
considerably more than indexing languages; question analyses and search
strategies to affect performance to a great extent - as much, if not  more
than indexing.. Retrieval systems seem to be able to perform at present only
on a general level, failing to be at the same time comprehensive and specific..
It seems that testing of total IR systems controlling and monitoring all
factors (environmental and systems-related) is not possible at present..
