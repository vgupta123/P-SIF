(on the erythropoietic effect of different
tissue suspensions)
the stimulating effect on erythropoiesis of regenerated liver and hyper-
trophic kidney tissue after partial hepatectomy and unilateral nephrectomy
respectively was studied in the rat by means of the erythrocyte count, haemo-
globin determination, reticulocyte count and 59fe utilization.  the
reticulocyte count and 59fe utilization increased significantly after treatment
with normal liver and renal tissue and more strongly after regenerated liver
and hypertrophic kidney tissue.  the same effect was seen after treatment
with the sera of rats which had undergone partial hepatectomy or unilateral
nephrectomy.
