Tests on Abstracts Journals
  The amount of scientific and technical information published 
annually in the form of journal articles, conference papers, reports, theses,
patents, and books now greatly exceeds, in every field of interest, the
amount which may be scanned by a scientist wishing to keep himself completely
up to date in his own subject.  For a scientist wishing to inform himself of
new developments in neighbouring subject-fields the problem is
even greater.  Consequently, either the scientist reconciles himself to the
knowledge that he is not aware of all relevant information in his field or
he places increasingly more reliance on such bibliographic tools as are
available to guide him towards the relevant literature.
  First among such tools is the abstracts journal.
