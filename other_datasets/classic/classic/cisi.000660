On Relevance, Probabilistic Indexing and Information Retrieval
   This paper reports on a novel technique for literature indexing and
searching in a mechanized library system.. The notion of relevance is taken
as the key concept in the theory of information retrieval and a comparative
concept of relevance is explicated in terms of the theory of probability.. 
The resulting technique called "Probabilistic Indexing," allows a computing
machine, given a request for information, to make a statistical inference
and derive a number (called the "relevance number") for each document, which
is a measure of the probability that the document will satisfy the given request
ranked according to their probable relevance..
   The paper goes on to show that whereas in a conventional library
system the cross-referencing ("see" and "see also") is based solely on
the "semantical closeness" between index terms, statistical measures of
closeness between index terms can be defined and computed.. Thus, given
an arbitrary request consisting of one (or many) index term(s), a machine
can elaborate on it to increase the probability of selecting relevant
documents that would not otherwise have been selected..
   Finally, the paper suggests an interpretation of the whole library
problem as one where the request is considered as a clue on the basis of
which the library system makes a concatenated statistical inference
in order to provide as an output an ordered list of those documents
which most probably satisfy the information needs of the user..
