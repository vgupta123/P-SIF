SMALGOL-61
Prior to and during the 1961 Western Joint
Computer Conference, several people in the Joint 
Users Groups had expressed interest in defining a "smalgol"
language.  This is to be an ALGOL language 
for use with compilers on relatively small size computers.
 A preliminary report resulted.  At the ACM 
National Conference four months later, after considering
several counter proposals, a final version was 
agreed upon by a subcommittee.  The recommendations
of the Subcommittee for a standard subset of ALGOL 
60 for use on small computers is presented here.
