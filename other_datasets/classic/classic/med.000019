infectious, and immunologic problems were responsible for their death . 
there was no evidence of resurgence of lupus erythematosus in either    
patient, and the transplanted kidneys did not show evidence of lupus    
nephritis . renal transplantation should be considered as a last resort 
in treatment of patients with terminal lupus nephritis .
