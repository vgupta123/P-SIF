the flow pattern on a tapered sweptback wing at mach numbers between 0.6
 and 1.6 .
the development of the flow pattern on a swept wing with incidence and
stream mach number is described . the wing, of aspect ratio 2 828,
taper ratio 0 333 and leading-edge sweep 53 5 deg, was tested at mach
numbers between 0 6 and 1 6 at incidences up to about 12 deg . the test
reynolds number varied with mach number, being typically 2 3 x 10 at m
leading edge .
it is shown that the flow pattern at moderate incidences develops
smoothly from a subsonic type involving leading-edge separation to a
supersonic type where the flow is attached near the leading edge and
with shock-induced separation further aft . the formation and movement
of the shock-wave system and the vortices near the wing surface are
briefly discussed .
