two and three-dimensional unsteady lift problems in high speed flight .
the problem of transient lift on two- and three-dimensional wings flying
 at high speeds is discussed as a boundary-value problem for the
classical wave equation . kirchhoffs formula is applied so that the
analysis is reduced, just as in the steady state, to an investigation of
 sources and doublets . the applications include the evaluation of
indicial lift and pitchingmoment curves for two-dimensional sinking and
pitching wings flying at mach numbers equal to 0, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and
triangular wings in both forward and reversed flow are presented and
compared with the two-dimensional values .
