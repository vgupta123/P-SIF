Overlap in the Lists of Journals Monitored by Biosis, CAS, and Ei
   In April 1970, the BioSciences Information Service of Biological Abstracts, 
the Chemical Abstracts Service, and Engineering Index, Inc. began a five-part
study to determine the relationships between and the overlap in coverage in
their printed publications and computer-readable services.. This study was 
designed to provide information needed by these three accessing services for 
planning future cooperative programs and for reconciling differences in policies
and practices so as to make their publications and services more useful to their
user communities..
   This paper is based on the first part of the study, which compared listings 
of the journals each service was routinely monitoring as of 1 May 1970.. Of the
14,592 different journals monitored, 1% were monitored by all three of the
services, 27% were monitored by two of the three services, and 72% were 
monitored by only one of the three services.. Subsequent phases of the study
will determine the extent to which the services cover the same articles within
the journals..
