Some Criteria for Time-Sharing System Performance
Time-sharing systems, as defined in this article,
are those multiaccess systems which permit 
a terminal user to utilize essentially the full resources
of the system while sharing its time with other 
terminal users.  It is each terminal user's ability
to utilize the full resources of the system that 
makes quantitative evaluation of time-sharing systems
particularly difficult.  Six criteria are described 
which have been successfully used to perform first-level
quantitative time-sharing system performance 
evaluation.
