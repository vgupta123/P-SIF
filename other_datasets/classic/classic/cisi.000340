Cooperation Between Types of Libraries
  This bibliography uses the traditional typology of libraries as its
starting point - public, school, academic-research, and special libraries.
This classification is most commonly used and provides a sufficiently clear
distinction for the purposes of this work.
  Public libraries are those which are free to all residents of the library's
district and supported primarily from general public funds or taxes levied
for library purposes.  Local public libraries, systems of public libraries,
and state library agencies are included in this category.
  School libraries are those maintained by the governing boards of
schools whether they be public, private, or parochial.  School libraries
at the elementary, junior high school, and senior high school level are
included.
  Academic-research libraries include the libraries of institutions of
higher education, both public and private, as well as libraries which,
while they might be defined as either public or special, are widely known
for their research resources.  Junior college libraries, college libraries,
university libraries, and technical school libraries are included as
academic libraries.  The Library of Congress, the Newberry Library, and 
Linda Hall Library are examples of nonacademic research libraries.
  Special libraries are those directed toward making information available
to people within a particular organization with fairly well-defined
information needs.  Business and industrial libraries and the libraries of
nonprofit organizations are common examples.
  While distinctions between research and special libraries are not
always easily made, it is felt that in the case of this bibliography, no
serious problems are created.
