The Cranfield Tests on Index Language Devices
   The investigation dealt with the effect which different devices have on the
performance of index languages.. It appeared that the most important 
consideration was the specificity of the index terms; within the context of the
conditions existing in this test, single-word terms were more effective than 
concept terms or a controlled vocabulary..
