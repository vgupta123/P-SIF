Cooperation Between Academic and Special Libraries
  The concept of library cooperation is examined generally and that among 
academic libraries, among special libraries, and between academic and special 
libraries as reported in the recent literature. The question of the probable 
future of cooperation between academic and special libraries is addressed and 
possible support mechanisms for establishing soundly based cooperative 
undertakings are suggested.
