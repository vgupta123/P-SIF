The New York Public Library Automated Book Catalog Subsystem
   A comprehensive automated bibliographic control system has been developed by
the New York Public Library.. This system is unique in its use of an automated 
authority system and highly sophisticated machine  filing algorithms.. The 
primary aim was the rigorous control of established forms and their 
cross-reference structure.. The original impetus for creation of the system,
and its most highly visible product, is a photocomposed book catalog.. The 
book catalog subsystem supplies automatic punctuation of condensed entries and
contains the ability to produce cumulation/supplement book catalogs in 
installments without loss of control of the cross referencing structure..
