Transparent-Mode Control Procedures for Data
Communication, Using the American Standard Code 
for Information Interchange -A Tutorial
This paper gives the considerations of Task
Group X3.3.4 in the area of transparent-mode data 
communication control philosophy.  The appearance of this
paper was forecast (underthe name of "second-level 
control") in the earlier tutorial paper, "Control Procedures
for Data Communications," Task Group document 
X3.3.4.44, dated May 1964.  The present paper elaborates
upon solutions to the problems of transparency 
to the basic ASCII communication control characters
as outlined in the previous paper mentioned above. 
 Moreover, it goes on to cover the additional control problems
of handling material such as off line encrypted 
data or non-ASCII codes by means of systems providing
complete character transparency.  It does not cover 
concepts of transparency in which the normal character
structure or modulation rate of a system may be 
abandoned.  In conjunction with the earlier tutorial
paper, this paper is expected to lead to a proposal 
for stand ardizationof data communication control procedures
using the American Stand ard Code for Information 
Interchange.
