aircraft flutter .
aircraft flutter .
  the term flutter is used here to denote maintained or
violent oscillations of a structure due to aerodynamic forces
acting in conjunction with both elastic and inertial forces .
attention is restricted to this particular branch of the more
general field of aeroelasticity, which embraces buffeting,
divergence, and reversal of control, as well as flutter,. airscrew
flutter is not specifically considered .  the monograph is
divided into three main parts, each of which has been made
self-contained for the convenience of readers .
  in the first part, general methods for the investigation
of aircraft flutter, by theoretical analysis and by experiments
on flutter models, are set out and discussed .  a detailed
account of the aerodynamic theory of wings in non-uniform
motion is not included, since this has already been provided
elsewhere, but methods for the evaluation of the aerodynamic
forces required in a theoretical flutter analysis are logically
developed, and a bibliography of researches on the
aerodynamic theory is given in the appendix .  investigations
on specific types of aircraft flutter--namely wing flutter,
control surface flutter, and tab flutter--are discussed in part
these various types of flutter are considered, but the practical
details of flutter-prevention devices are omitted .  finally,
in part 3, methods for the experimental determination of
airloads on oscillating aerofoil systems are described, and
available airload measurements are analysed and compared
with theoretical results .
  an attempt has been made to refer in the text to all relevant
british work reported by the early part of 1947 .  foreign
work has been mentioned in parts 1 and 2 only where necessary
for the sake of completeness, but in part 3 and the
appendix all relevant foreign references known to the author have
been included .
  matrix notation has been used for the theoretical treatment in
part 1, but otherwise its use has been avoided .
