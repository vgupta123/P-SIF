theory of steady supersonic flow .
  the hyperbolic character of the differential
equation satisfied by the velocity
potential in linearized supersonic flow entails
the presence of fractional infinities
in the fundamental solutions of the equation .
difficulties arising from this fact can
be overcome by the introduction of hadamard's
finite part of an infinite integral .
together with the definition of certain counterparts
of the familiar vector operators
this leads to a natural development of the analogy
between incompressible flow
and linearized supersonic flow .  in particular, formulae
are derived for the field of
flow due to an arbitrary distribution of supersonic
sources and vortices .
  applications to aerofoil theory, including the
calculation of the downwash in the
wake of an aerofoil, are given in a separate report (ref. 9) .
