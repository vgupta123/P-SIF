On Selecting a Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness
   It is argued that a user's subjective evaluation of the personal
utility of a retrieval system's output to him, if it could be properly
quantified, would be a near-ideal measure of retrieval effectiveness..
A hypothetical methodology is presented for measuring this utility by
means of an elicitation procedure.. Because the hypothetical methodology
is impractical, compromise methods are outlined and their underlying
simplifying assumptions are discussed.. The more plausible the simplifying
assumptions on which a performance measure is based, the better the measure..
This, along with evidence gleaned from 'validation experiments' of a certain
kind, is suggested as a criterion for selecting or deriving the best measure
of effectiveness to use under given test conditions..
