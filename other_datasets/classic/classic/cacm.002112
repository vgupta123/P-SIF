Translation Equations
Input limited transduction expressions, or translation equations,
are used to describe the syntax and left-context sensitive semantics for 
context-free languages.  A formal procedure is given for deriving from
a set of translation equations the specifications for a pushdown translator.
The translator consists of Mealy form finite-state automata interacting
by means of a pushdown stack.  Within the framework described string 
recognition and parsing may be treated as special cases of the translation 
problem.
