the treatment of phosphatic encrusted cystitis
(alkaline cystitis) with nalidixic acid.
phosphatic encrusted cystitis is caused by
persistent infection by b. proteus or ps. pyocyaneus
associated with an alkaline urine.  its incidence
may be increasing and may follow megavoltage
therapy of a bladder tumour.  its incidence in
post-radiation cases is 2 per cent.
mandelamine often fails to relieve this
condition.  in this series of ten patients who had
failed to respond to mandelamine, eight
responded to treatment with nalidixic acid.  no side
effect of treatment was noted in the series.
nalidixic acid is of value in the treatment of b. proteus
infections of the urinary tract, and is the drug
of choice in the treatment of phosphatic encrusted
cystitis.
