the performance of supersonic turbine nozzles .
  an investigation has been conducted
at the national gas turbine establishment into the
performance of turbines having high pressure ratios
per stage .  the present report discusses the mode of
operation of supersonic nozzles for such turbines,
and describes a cascade experiment .  both theory and
experiment demonstrate that the conditions imposed
upon the supersonic flow immediately downstream
of the nozzles (e.g., by a following row of rotor blades)
exert an overriding influence upon the nozzle outlet
flow angle, and hence upon the maximum pressure
ratio obtainable across the nozzle--providing that the
axial component of velocity is subsonic .  this is an
important difference from the more familiar flow of
subsonic turbine nozzles, where, for example, the
downstream gas angle is controlled predominantly by the
nozzle blade shape and spacing .  a suitable test technique
using a closed-jet tunnel is demonstrated .
  the particular nozzles tested, of convergent-divergent
form, had a straight-sided divergent portion of
to axial direction) and a design mach number of 2 .
the flow was found to be well behaved as regards shock
pattern, losses, and starting over the range of pressure
ratios tested--between 9 1 and 19 1 .  in particular the
efficiency at the design pressure ratio of 16.6 1 was
high, the velocity coefficient calculated from traverses of
pitot and static tubes being 0.98 .
  for the conversion of pitot to total pressure at a mach
number of 2.5 a high accuracy is important in the
measurement of the static pressure,. nevertheless readings
from a conventional four-hole instrument appear to
be reliable .
