Computer-Made Perspective Movies as a Scientific and Communication Tool*
It is easy to program the basic transformation
required for a perspective drawing.  This fact 
plus the advent of high speed microfilm printers such
as the General Dynamics Electronics S-C 4020 makes 
possible perspective movies as the direct output from
a computer.  The programming of such a movie is 
briefly described for studying the angular motions of
a satellite containing an attitude control system. 
 In the movie, a domino-shaped box represents the satellite
and a sphere with circles of latitude and 
longitude represents the earth.  The cost was approximately
three to eight minutes of IBM 7090 time per 
one minute of movie.
