A Decision Theory View of the Information Retrieval Situation:
An Operations Research Approach
   A decision theory approach is used to model the information retrieval 
decision problem of which documents to retrieve from a library collection in 
response to a specific user query for information.. A thorough discussion of
decision theory, including the components of the alternatives,states-of-nature,
outcomes, and evaluations - as well as of the optimization process under the 
cases of certainty, risk, and uncertainty - is presented.. Bayesian statistics
are also discussed to show how prior information about the various documents 
via classification analysis can affect the decision process under risk.. An 
example problem is used to illustrate the decision theory approach and to
compare tha overall performance of the retrieval system under risk with and
without document classification information..
   Thus, the operations research technique of decision theory is used to model
the retrieval decision process, illustrate how important evaluation is, and to
demonstrate the value of prior information via document classification 
analysis.. Moreover, the paper presents, in a somewhat tutorial mode, an
overall framework for considering the information retrieval decision problem,
incorporating the aspects of cost-effectiveness and alternative evaluation,
which allows one to better understand the contributions made by many 
researchers in this crucial area..
