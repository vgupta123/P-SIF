approximate formulas for thermal-stress analysis .
the basis of any thermal-stress analysis is the determination of the
temperature distributions in the structure .  for arbitrary flight
histories, the determination of such distributions is rather tedious
and not completely general .  this latter fact handicaps optimization
studies in the project design stage when it is desirable to be able to
express the thermal-stress distributions in a general manner .
in this note, general expressions are derived for the thermal-stress
distributions in a typical i-section using similar assumptions to
those of biot .
