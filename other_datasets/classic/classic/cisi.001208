Keeping up with What's Going on in Physics 
AIP's Current Physics Information program offers new products                      
to help scientists and engineers stay up-to-date
  In 1966, AIP had a modest program in physics information supported by the
National Science Foundation.  The program went back several years, and
AIP was considering a major expansion. The first task faced in such an
expansion was to augment the staff so as to be interdisciplinary in physics,
computer operations and scientific information.  The staff would be able
to analyze and extend the studies made at AIP and elsewhere, and would 
formulate a basic approach.
