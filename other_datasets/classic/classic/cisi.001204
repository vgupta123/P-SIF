An Introduction to Computational Geometry
  The goal of this study is to reach a deeper understanding of some
concepts we believe are crucial to the general theory of computation.
We will study in great detail a class of computations that make
decisions by weighing evidence.  Certainly, this problem is of
great interest in itself, but our real hope is that understanding
of its mathematical structure will prepare us eventually to go
further into the almost unexplored theory of parallel computers.
