Adaptive Correction of Program Statements
A method of analyzing statements in a programming
language which can tolerate a considerable 
inaccuracy in their specification is proposed. This method
involves principles at present mainly confined 
to studies in the area of artificial intelligence such
as feature extraction, approximate tree matching, 
and strategy improvement by feedback from the matching process.
 A pilot program incorporating the principles 
is described and preliminary operating results are presented.
 A final section surveys further principles 
which are currently being investigated.
