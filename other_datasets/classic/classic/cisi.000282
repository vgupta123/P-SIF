Classifying Courses in the University Catalog
   The authors contrast the university catalog and the card catalog and conclude
that the university catalog is the best guide to the university's current 
scholarly interest.. They urge that librarians study and classify courses 
therein, such as books, using the Library of Congress or Dewey Decimal schemes
so that specific class number are grouped by academic department and become
substantial spans.. The profile can be used as a selection tool, as a 
correlating tool between curriculum, circulation and publishing, and as a 
device to aid weeding and shelving.. General and specific quidelines for 
classifying, including a method for resolving apparent duplication of courses 
in different departments are presented.. Time and unit figures are tabulated..
Specific steps in classification and editing are described..
