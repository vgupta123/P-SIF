Cataloging U.S.A.
  The book deals almost entirely with theory and principles.  Only
now and then, if it seems necessary to a complete understanding of
the implications of theory, is some detail of practice briefly 
described.
  It follows that the work is not a substitute for rules of entry and
description, subject headings rules and lists, classification schemes, or
other similar reference books.  Instead, it is only a commentary on such
works, and it does not profess to comment on more than a few of
what seem to be the most important aspects of each.
  Comments are made only on cataloging in the United States.
Many interesting practices have always been part of cataloging
abroad.  But to write of these practices also would have taken several
books.  This work looks at the foreign scene only when it seems
necessary to understand fully some procedure in this country.  If a
reader in some other country finds anything in this book helpful,
that will be, I hope, good for him and for his country's cataloging.
I am not at all sure, however, that what we do and think in this
country will be of value in other countries with other conditions.  In
no sense is this a book of American intellectual imperialism.
