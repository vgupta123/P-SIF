Medical Libraries and the Assessment of User Needs
   Users of information in science and technology have been studied in great
detail with respect to material read, amount of time spent in reading and
searching the literature, categories of questions asked, an so on.. Probing
for this information has been undertaken by means of structured  and 
unstructured  interviews, diaries, surveys, and questionnaires..
   Although a large amount of data has emerged on information usage and flow,
the subjective response of scientists furnishes comment only on the satisfaction
produced by present information services and does not yield insight into the
extent to which needs remain unsatisfied.. Relevance  figures based upon the
response of systems to questions cannot be equated with satisfaction of needs,
since questions constitute, in most cases, inadequate representations of 
underlying information needs..
   Assessment of the needs of users of medical libraries and information system
must, in fact, be made in relation to the observed behavior and experience of
biomedical scientists.. There is room for well-designed experimentation which
can explore the interaction of both psychological and environmental factors..
Significant differences in information needs exist among and between individuals
such as researches and clinicians  in the same environment.. With respect to
environment, it is hypothesized that the information needs for medical
practitioners in remote areas might differ significantly from those of their
colleagues working in large metropolitan centers in close proximity to medical
schools, research institutions, and other rich sources of information fallout..
   It is anticipated that experimentation will eventually result in a
methodology which will permit the determination and prediction of the
information needs of any identified groups of users in a specific environment..
