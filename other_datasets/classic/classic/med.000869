studies on hydroxyproline excretion and corticosteroid-induced
dwarfism: treatment with human growth hormone.
   two children who had been receiving large doses
of corticosteroids for years and were growing at a retarded
rate were treated with human growth hormone.
growth rate increased 2.5 to 3-fold and urinary hydroxyproline
excretion which was initially low increased
to the normal level.  when treatment was stopped, growth
rate and hydroxyproline excretion decreased promptly.
