compressible laminar flow and heat transfer about a
rotating isothermal disk .
  the flow and heat transfer about a rotating isothermal disk are
re-examined to include the effects of compressibility and property
variations .  if viscous dissipation is neglected,
the compressible problem is
correlated to the incompressible problem by assuming linear variations
of viscosity and thermal conductivity with temperature .  certain
inaccuracies in several previous incompressible solutions are noted and
corrected herein .  the effect of compressibility appears as a
distortion of the normal coordinate and normal velocity component and as
a multiplicative factor in the heat-transfer coefficient, the nusselt
number, and in the expressions for the skin-friction components and
torque required to rotate the disk .
