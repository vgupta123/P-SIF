Scientific Management of Library Operations
  This book is intended both as a textbook for library school students
and a handbook for practicing librarians.  It will acquaint the former
with the basic tools of the management analyst and will aid the latter
in improving their present systems.  The major analysis techniques are
described in step-by-step detail, with a wealth of illustrations and
library examples.
