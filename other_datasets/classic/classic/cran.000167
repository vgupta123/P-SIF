linearized flow of a dissociating gas .
linearized flow of a dissociating gas .
the equations for planar two-dimensional
steady flow of an ideal dissociating gas
are linearized, assuming small disturbances
to a free stream in chemical
equilibrium .
  as an example of their solution, the
flow past a sharp corner in a supersonic
stream is evaluated and the variations
of flow properties in the relaxation zone
are found .  numerical illustrations are
provided using an 'oxygen-like' ideal gas
and comparisons made with a characteristics
solution .  the flow past a sharp
corner can be studied in a conventional
shock tube and it may be possible to
verify the present theory experimentally .
in particular it may prove feasible to
use the results to obtain a measure of the
reaction rates in the gas mixture .
