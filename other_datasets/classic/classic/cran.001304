newtonian flow over a surface .
newtonian flow over a surface .
a general method is presented for
the study of a three-dimensional
hypersonic flow about a body of arbitrary shape when .
the manner of constructing a double
asymptotic development in
and is shown .  formulae are given
which enable the first three terms of
this development to be obtained while neglecting .
the theory is then applied to the case of
a body of circular-cone shape .  the
pressure is given as a triple development
in accordance with the preceding
parameters and the angle of attack,. this
development neglects .  a. ferri's
vortical layer is brought into evidence .
a second application is devoted to
calculation of the total forces acting
upon bodies of revolution at angles of
incidence, while neglecting .
general formulae are
established for the coefficients of axial
force, normal force and moments .
the formulae are developed according
to the powers of incidence, the first
terms of each formula being of very simple form .
