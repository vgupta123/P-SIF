The Changing Role of Directors of University Libraries
   The role of the university library director has changed markedly in the last 
decade.. The position of library director has become a difficult role to serve..
Directors has been subjected to pressures from different quarters.. Five sources
are identified by the authors, including pressures from the president's office,
library stuff, faculty, and students.. These difficulties coupled with a 
declining ability to meet user needs, the lack of cohesive library planning, 
and an institutional inability to accommodate change have all contributed to the
declining status of the library director.. Recommendations as to ways to 
ameliorate the problem are offered.. Among the suggestions included are better
planning, improved budgeting techniques, and the introduction of new 
organizational patterns..
