A Multiple-Precision Division Algorithm
A generalized division algorithm for use with positive integral operands is 
presented.  Depending upon the algebraic relationship of the first
two ciphers of the divisor, one or at most two adjustments to the original 
divisor and dividend must be performed before the division operation can be 
initiated. The uniqueness of this method will cause each trial cipher in the 
quotient to be either equal to or one greater than its final replacement.
