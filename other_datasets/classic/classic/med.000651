case of salpingitis due to pleuro-pneumonalike
organisms
a case of acute salpingitis following a diagnostic curettage and
aspiration of the pouch of douglas is described.  this case was resistant
to penicillin and streptomycin therapy.  a pure culture of pleuropneu-
monia like organisms (pplo) grew from pus removed from the secon-
dary pyosalpinx by aspiration.  these organisms were sensitive to tetra-
cycline which cured the adnexal infection.  no pplo were found in the
vaginal discharge.
pplo have frequently been isolated from the vaginae of healthy
and infected women.  however, only 9 cases of pelvic inflammatory
disease with a pure culture of pplo have been reported.  the possibi-
lity that these growths of pplo in the internal genitalia followed the
use of antibiotic therapy is discussed.
infection with pplo should be considered when pelvic inflam-
matory disease proves resistant to the common antibiotics.
