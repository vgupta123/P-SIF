earth satellite observations and the upper atmosphere .
atmospheric densities have been derived from artificial satellites in
altitudes 200-700 km. and from rockets up to about 200 km. to
consolidate the two sets of data, h.k. kallmann suggested a model with a
exact form of this curve has now been derived . corrections for the
 is excellent .
very close correlation between atmospheric density variations/h180 km./
and the solar 20-cm. radiation implies that the origin of the'solar
effect'may lie in the absorption of solar ultra-violet radiation .
the atmospheric density curve between 180 and 200 km. shows a
temperature inversion in the fl-layer . it is not yet possible to decide
 whether solar ultra-violet radiation as well as the solar he line and
solar x-ray radiation contribute to the heating of the fl-layer .
diurnal and seasonal density variations at altitudes 210, 562 and 660
km. have been derived from variations in acceleration of three
satellites/sputnik 3, vanguard 1 and 2/ . group averages of diurnal
variations are taken from different dates within the period
may 15, 1958-october 1, 1959 . physcal conditions in the upper
atmosphere are briefly summarized ..the'solar effect'originates in the
fl-layer as a result of heating by the solar he line at 304 a. diurnal
density variation at 210 km. is only a few per cent . absorption of
solar electromagnetic radiation in the f2-layer, and large heat
conductivity cause intense diurnal density and temperature variations above
