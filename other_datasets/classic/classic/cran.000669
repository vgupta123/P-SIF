subsonic potential flow past a sphere inside a cylindrical duct .
subsonic potential flow past a sphere inside a cylindrical duct .
the subsonic potential flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere
in an infinite medium was first determined by rayleigh .  subsequently,
caplan and tamada extended the solution to include the fourth power
of the mach number .  to the author's knowledge, no solution for
subsonic flow past a sphere in a finite medium has been published .  it
is the purpose of this note to present a solution for subsonic
potential flow past a sphere inside a circular cylindrical duct .
