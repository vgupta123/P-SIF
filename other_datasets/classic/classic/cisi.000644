A Decision Theoretic Foundation for Indexing
   The indexing of a document is among the most crucial steps in preparing that 
document for retrieval.. The adequacy of the indexing determines the ability of 
the system to respond to patron requests.. This paper discusses this process,
and document retrieval in general, on the basis of formal decision theory.. The
basic theoretical approach taken is illustrated by means of a model of word 
occurrences in documents in the context of a model information system; both 
models are fully defined in this paper.. Though the main purpose of this paper
is to provide insights into a very complex process, formulae are developed that 
may prove to be of value for an automated operating system..The paper concludes
with an interpretation of recall and precision curves as seen from the point of 
view of decision theory..
