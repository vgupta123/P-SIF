laminar heat transfer in tubes under slip-flow conditions .
the effects of low-density phenomena on the
fully developed heat-transfer characteristics
for laminar flow in tubes has been studied
analytically .  consideration is given to the
slip-flow regime wherein the major rarefaction
effects are manifested as velocity and
temperature jumps at the tube wall .  the
analysis is carried out for both uniform wall
temperature and uniform wall heat flux .
in both cases, the slip-flow nusselt numbers
are lower than those for continuum flow
and decrease with increasing mean free path .
extension of the results is made to include
the effects of shear work at the wall,
temperature jump modifications for a moving fluid,
and thermal creep .
