Information Service in Libraries
        The two studies presented here represent efforts
to measure the performance of library staffs in an unobstrusive
fashion:  that is, to apply certain tests generally
similar to portions of the normal workload without drawing
attention to the fact that a test is being carried out.  The
two projects were rather different as to purpose, method,
and reliability of result (that is, statistical significance).
Dr. Crowley's investigation, the first in point of time,
arose partly from his experience in a county library.  His
curiousity about the real result of the reference activities
(as different from merely counting the questions answered)
led him to ask, "Is there substantial difference between the
claims made by librarians for reference work and the actual
result as observed in a number of different situations by
individuals posing as clients?"  The study which followed
from this question was, then, exploratory and necessarily
less rigidly controlled than was the second study of this
pair.
