Partitioning Algorithms for Finite Sets
The partitions of a set with n elements are represented
by certain n-tuples of positive integers. 
 Algorithm are described which generate without repetitions
the n-tuples corresponding to: (1) all partitions 
of the given set, (2) all partitions of the given set
into m or fewer sets (1 <= m <= n), and (3) all 
partitions of the given set into exactly m sets (1 <= m <= n).
