Research Studies in Scientific Communication: IV.
The Continuity of Dissemination of Information by "Productive Scientists"
   This article is the last in series which describes a set of studies which
were conducted over a 4,5-year period (1966-1971).. The series of articles 
sought to describe a comprehensive picture of the dissemination and assimilation
of scientific information as it flows through various informal and formal media,
from the time a scientist initiates his work until it is published.. The 
present article examines the continuity of scientific work and information 
exchange by "productive scientists" two years after the publication of their 
articles in 1968/1969.. The results indicate that about half of the authors had
changed to a subject-matter area which differed from that of their earlier
articles, however, such shifts did not decrease authors' productivity nor 
greatly increase their information needs..
