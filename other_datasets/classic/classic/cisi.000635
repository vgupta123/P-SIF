Clustering of Scientific Journals
A cluster analysis procedure is described in which 188 journals in the
discipline of physics, chemistry and molecular biology are grouped into 
clusters.. Most of the clusters are easily identified as subdisciplinary
subject areas.. The data source was the cross citing amongst the journals
derived from the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived in turn from
the Science Citation Index (SCI).. The JCI consists of journal by journal
tabulation of citings to and from each journal processed in the SCI..
Two-step citation maps linking the clusters are presented for each 
discipline.. Within the disciplines the clusters of journals form fully
transitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..
