Implementation of High Level Language Machine
Computing machines which directly execute
the statements of a high level language have been 
proposed in the past.  This report describes the actual
implementation of such a machine: it is a computer 
whose "machine language" is APL.  The machine is fully
operational and correctly executes almost all 
of the APL operations on scalars, vectors, and arrays.
 The machine automatically allocates memory, executes 
statements, calls functions, converts numbers from one
type to another, checks subscripts, and automatically 
detects many types of programmer errors.
