A Lightpen-Controlled Program For On-Line Data Analysis
This paper describes a technique designed
to ease the use of a data processing system by a 
person, in particular, a scientist, who is intimately and
primarily concerned with interpreting the significance 
of data handled by the system.  Since such a person is
often unable to spend the time necessary to master 
a programming language, it is essential that he be aided
in composing commands to the computer.  In the 
system described, the user is not required to learn
or remember the vocabulary of the language because 
the vocabulary is displayed before him on"menus" by
means of a computer-drive scope.  He selects the 
various vocabulary elements required by pointing with
the light pen.  By use of a small unordered set 
of rewriting rules applied as a result of light pen
selections, the user generates only syntactically
correct commands to the system.  He does not have to learn
or remember the grammar.  The program restricts 
the user severely in the particular language he can use,
but the method for communicating with the program 
makes these restrictions seem quite natural and unconstraining.
 The program has been used successfully 
for over ten months.
