cantilever plate with concentrated edge load .
  the author gives, by the method of finite differences, an
approximate solution of the problem of a finite length
of a cantilever plate which bears a concentrated load at
the longitudinal free edge .  all the boundary conditions
are taken into account, and the plate action is
determined approximately at all points of the plate .  the
author points out that a secondary maximum transverse
stress occurs at the clamped edge nearest the loading
point, and that the longitudinal stress is greatest directly
under the loading point .
