risk of severe jaundice in
glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase
deficiency of the newborn
the incidence of g.-6-p.d. deficiency and neonatal
jaundice in all male infants born in one year in an area of
the island of lesbos was studied.
of 634 infants tested, 29 (4.6%) were found to be
g.-6-p.d. deficient.  hyperbilirubinaemia of 16 mg. per
100 ml. or over was observed in 34% of g.-6-p.d.-
deficient newborn males and in 9.1% of those with normal
enzyme activity--in more than half of them in the absence
of incompatibility or prematurity.
this is the first time that such a high incidence of
severe neonatal jaundice has been reported in both a
g.-6-p.d.-deficient and a g.-6-p.d.-normal group.  it is
postulated that in the population of lesbos a second
factor increases the incidence of neonatal jaundice,
especially when this factor is combined with
g.-6-p.d. deficiency.
