MEDLEARN: An Orientation to MEDLINE
   ***MEDLEARN***, an orientation to MEDLINE, was developed to educate members
of the biomedical community to become competent on-line searchers.. It appears
in two complementary forms: an interactive terminal presentation available on
the TYMSHARE Network and a supporting hard-copy manual which contains the
didactic portions of the computer program as well as additional items which are
not suitable for on-line presentation.. ***MEDLEARN***, a flexible instruction
tool, is divided into forty sections which may be selected in various sequences
depending on the user's previous experience.. Two MEDLINE simulations and
feedback sections after practice on MEDLINE provide motivation for continued
learning.. The orientation program was evaluated at several medical centers
with uniformly favorable results..
