The Development of the MU5 Computer System
Following a brief outline of the background
of the MU5 project, the aims and ideas for MU5 
are discussed.  A description is then given of the instruction
set, which includes a number of features 
conducive to the production of efficient compiled code
from high-level language source programs.  The 
design of the processor is then traced from the initial
ideas for an associatively addressed "name store" 
to the final multistage pipeline structure involving
a prediction mechanism for instruction prefetching 
and a function queue for array element accessing.  An
overall view of the complete MU5 complex is presented 
together with a brief indication of its performance.
