Generation of Test Matrices by Similarity Transformations
A method for obtaining test matrices with
a prescribed distribution of characteristic roots 
is given.  The process consists of using particularly
simple similarity transformations to generate full 
matrices from canonical forms.  The matrices generated
also have known characteristic vectors, inverses 
and determinants.
