Automatic Indexing: An Experimental Inquiry
   This inquiry examines a technique for automatically classifying (indexing)
documents according to their subject content.. The task, in essence, is to have
a computing machine read a document and on the basis of the occurrence of 
selected clue words decide to which of many subject categories the document in
question belongs.. This paper describes the design, execution and evaluation of 
a modest experimental study aimed at testing empirically one statistical 
technique for automatic indexing..
