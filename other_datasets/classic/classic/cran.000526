leading edge attachment in transonic flow with laminar
or turbulent boundary layers .
  the transonic flow round a two-dimensional airfoil at
incidence is often determined by the type of flow in the leading-edge
region .  if the flow separates at the leading edge at low speeds it
is liable to attach as the speed increases, often quite suddenly .
a review of this change with laminar or with turbulent boundary
layers re-emphasizes the importance of fixing transition when
making model tests at transonic speeds in order to obtain flows
closest to full-scale conditions .
  it is shown that similar airfoils with attached leading-edge
flow show transonic similarity upstream of the terminal shock .
