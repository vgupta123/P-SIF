Copying Methods Manual
  The current need for a manual of copying methods dealing with the processes, 
methods, techniques, and types of equipment which can be used for reproducing 
documents of a great many different kinds arises from two factors:
  (1) The great importance of document reproduction processes in the 
acquisition, preservation, dissemination, and communication of information
vital to the conduct of research work in all fields of human endeavor and on an 
international scale.
  (2) The complexity of the field of document reproduction today which has 
resulted from the enormous technical advances made in the past fifteen years.
  The need for the coining of the new class word - reprography (an unfortunate
graft of a Latin fragment on a Greek root) - is in itself indicative of the 
great changes that have come about.  Processes and methods which formerly were 
discrete and distinctive have now become intricately interrelated. New processes
and combinations of processes with different and astonishing capabilities
continue to appear.  This revolution in the document copying field has been 
powerfully augmented by intensive competition on the part of manufacturers for 
a share of the vast and lucrative office-records copying field.  The results, 
however, have led to highly important applications in the reproduction of 
research materials as well.
