A Card Format for Reference Files in Information Processing
This paper proposes a card format suitable for
a variety of reference files in information 
processing.  An 80-column IBM card is divided into two
fields-reference material field (columns 1-67) 
and identification field (columns 68-80).  The format
for the reference material is flexible, while the 
format for the identification is rigid.  The reference
material includes basically an index, title, source, 
class, summary and cross reference for each entry. 
The identification includes basically codes for a 
matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind,
major interest, and source of the reference.  The 
identification also provides a choice to identify material
for personal as well as general files.  Since 
this card format is sufficient to identify the material
normally associated with reference files for 
books, articles, programming terms, hardware terms, equipment,
machine systems, abbreviations, etc., it 
is suitable as a standard for card reference files in information processing.
