Evolving the 90% Pharmaceutical Library
  The growing need for library space dictated a quantitative study to
ascertain user requirements.  A monitoring operation has been established
whereby data are continuously collected on the use made of periodicals shelved
in a restricted storage area.  The data, obtained from photocopy request forms,
identify the core collection of journals which satisfies 90% of our library 
research requirements.
