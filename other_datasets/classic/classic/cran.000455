modified cross-lees mixing theory for supersonic separated
and reattaching flows .
  re-examination of the crocco-lees method has shown that the
previous quantitative disagreement between theory and
experiment in the region of flow up to separation was caused primarily
by the improper c(k) relation assumed .  a new c(k) correlation,
based on low-speed theoretical and experimental data and on
supersonic experimental results has been developed and found to
be satisfactory for accurate calculation of two-dimensional,
laminar, supersonic flows up to separation .
a physical model which incorporates the concept of the /dividing/
streamline and the results of experiment .  according to this
physical model, viscous momentum transport is the essential
mechanism in the zone between separation and the beginning of
reattachment, while the reattachment process is, on the contrary,
an essentially inviscid process .  this physical model has been
translated into crocco-lees languages using a semiempirical
approach, and approximate c(k) and f(k) relations have been
determined for the separated and reattaching regions .  the
results of this analysis have been applied to the problem of
shockwave, laminar-boundary-layer interaction, and satisfactory
  a study of separated and reattaching regions of flow has led to
quantitative agreement with experiment has been achieved .
