constant-temperature magneto-gasdynamic channel flow .
in the course of investigating boundary-layer flow in
continuous plasma accelerators with crossed electric and
magnetic fields, it was found advantageous to have at hand simple
closed-form solutions for the magneto-gasdynamic flow in the
duct which could serve as free-stream conditions for the boundary
layers .  nontrivial solutions of this sort are not available at
present, and in fact, as in the work of resler and sears, the
variation of conditions along the flow axis must be obtained
through numerical integration .
  consequently, some simple solutions of magneto-gasdynamic
channel flow were sought, possessing sufficient algebraic simplicity
to serve as free-stream boundary conditions for analytic
investigations of the boundary layer in a physically reasonable accelerator .
in particular, since the cooling of the accelerator tube is likely to
be an important physical problem because of the high gas
temperatures required to provide sufficient gaseous conductivity,
channel flow with constant temperature appears interesting .
some simple algebraic solutions for the case of a constant
temperature plasma are developed in the following paragraphs .
