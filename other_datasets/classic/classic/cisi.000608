A new comparison Between Conventional Indexing (MEDLARS) 
and Automatic Text Processing (SMART)
   A new testing process is described designed to compare conventional retrieval
(MEDLARS) and automatic text analysis methods (SMART).. The results obtained 
with a collection of documents chosen independently of either SMART or MEDLARS
indicate that a simple automatic extraction of keywords from document abstracts
produces a 30 to 40 percent loss compared with MEDLARS indexing.. A replacement
of the unranked Boolean searches used in MEDLARS by the standard ranked output 
normally provided by SMART reduces the loss to between 15 and 20 percent.. When
automatically generated word control list or a thesaurus is used as part of the 
SMART analysis, the results are comparable in effectiveness to those obtained 
by the intellectual MEDLARS indexing.. Finally, the incorporation of user 
feedback procedures into SMART furnishes an improvement over the normal MEDLARS 
output of 15 to 30 percent.. 
   One concludes again that no technical justification exists for maintaining 
controlled, manual indexing in operational retrieval environments..
