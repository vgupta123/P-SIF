exact solution of the neumann problem . calculation
for non- circulatory plane and axially symmetric flows
about or within arbitrary boundaries .
  an exact general method of solving
the neumann or second boundary-value
problem has been developed and has been
applied to the calculation of
low-speed flows about or within bodies of
almost any shape, provided the flow is
either plane or has axial symmetry .
solid-body, inlet, and purely internal
flow problems can be solved .  the
method is capable of dealing with several
bodies at once in the presence of
one another, and consequently interference
problems can be treated with ease .
boundaries need not be solid, that is,
flows involving area suction can be
calculated .  velocities can be computed
not only for points on the surface of
the body but for the entire flow field .
  a surface source distribution is
used as a basis for solution .  this
leads to a fredholm integral equation
of the second kind, which is solved as
a set of linear algebraic equations,
usually by a modified seidel method .
at the present time the solution is
programed on the ibm 704 edpm to solve
the flow about any body that has the
previously mentioned characteristics
and whose profile can be defined
satisfactorily by no more than 300
coordinate points .  a number of solutions
are presented, to show both the scope
of the method and its accuracy .
computations require from three minutes
to two hours, depending upon the
shape of the body and the number of points
used to define it .
