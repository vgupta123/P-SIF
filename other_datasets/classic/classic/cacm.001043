Talk-A High-Level Source Language Debugging
Technique With Real-Time Data Extraction
TALK, meaning Take A Look, is a debugging technique
which aids substantially in debugging complex 
real-time programming systems by interrupting the users
program at desired points to extract previously 
specified data.  The extracted data is later edited,
listing the associated data with its high-level 
source language identification.
