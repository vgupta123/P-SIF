Scientific Knowledge
  This is an essay in the sociology of scientific knowledge written with
the sociology of knowledge and culture, generally, very much in
mind.  As a sociological study it is unusual in that the form and
content of scientific knowledge is the main concern and not its
organization or distribution.
