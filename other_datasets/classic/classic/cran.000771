on the flow of a compressible fluid past a sphere .
  it was shown by raleigh (philos. mag. 32, 1 (1916))
that the velocity potential for the subsonic flow of a
compressible fluid past a sphere can be expressed as a power
series in terms of mach's number m (which is the ratio of
the undisturbed velocity u, divided by the velocity of sound
for the undisturbed flow) .  the equation in question is
and boundary conditions are prescribed for
raleigh himself computed the first two terms of this series,.
the author finds the third term .  he gives some graphs
showing numerical differences between raleigh's and his
approximation .
