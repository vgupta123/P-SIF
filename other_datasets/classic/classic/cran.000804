a flight test investigation of the sonic boom .
  the /sonic boom/ as it is now popularly called, has become the
center of considerable interest during the past few years because of
widespread public disturbance and possible damage that can result
from it .  in the hopes of minimizing this disturbance and to extend
the general knowledge of the shock waves which produce the booming
noise, the aeronautical research laboratory, wright air development
center, has initiated an extensive research program to study the sonic
boom phenomenon .
  this report presents the results of flight tests undertaken as one
phase of this program .  the tests had as their objective the
determination and measurement of the shock wave pressure pattern surrounding
an f-100 aircraft in level supersonic flight .
  the flight tests were conducted at the air force flight test
center, edwards air force base, california, under the authority of air
research and development command test directive no. 5524-f1 .
