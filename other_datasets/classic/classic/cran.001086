a note on the numerical solution of fourth order differential
equations .
  an old numerical method
of solving fourth order differential equations
is put in relaxation form .  the higher
order correction terms are included and the
technique is illustrated by an example .
the method has the advantage of being more
rapidly convergent than the usual relaxation
procedure for fourth order equations .
some comments are made on the numerical
solution of the viscous flow equation .
