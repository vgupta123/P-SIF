Recursion Analysis for Compiler Optimization
A relatively simple method for the detection
of recursive use of procedures is presented for 
use in compiler optimization.  Implementation considerations
are discussed, and a modification of the 
algorithm is given to further improve optimization.
 This analysis can also be used to determine what 
possible subset of values could be assumed by variables
which can only take on a relatively small discrete 
set of values.  The most common are parameters of variables
assuming values of label, procedure, or Pascal's 
enumerated type.
