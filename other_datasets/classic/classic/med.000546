the unreliability of the titan yellow method
for the determination of magnesium
in patients receiving intravenous
calcium gluconate
gluconate was found to interfere with the determination of magnesium by the
titan yellow method.  with this method, false low results were found in the
serum and urine of patients receiving intravenous calcium gluconate.  the
interference can be prevented by ashing of the specimen.
