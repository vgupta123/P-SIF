adjuvant chemotherapy in cancer of the
large bowel
the completeness of reporting, the avail-
ability of continuous statistical analysis to
warn of adverse effects, and the accumulation
of 300 cases a year have demonstrated that this
cooperative study group can provide a rela-
tively quick assessment of a new approach to
treatment of cancer of the large bowel.  it is
hoped that a study begun in january, 1962, on
the use of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine as an adjuvant
to adequate excisional surgery may demon-
strate that, with a drug known to produce
objective remissions in 20 per cent of a group
of unresectable cases of colon carcinoma
the five year survival rate in curative resections
may be improved.
