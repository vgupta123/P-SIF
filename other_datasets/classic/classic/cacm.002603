The Equivalence of Reducing Transition
Languages and Deterministic Languages
The class of reducing transition languages
introduced by Eickel, Paul, Bauer, and Samelson 
was shown by Morris to be a proper superclass of the
simple precedence languages.  In this paper this 
result is extended, showing that, in fact, the first class
is equivalent to the class of deterministic 
context free languages.
