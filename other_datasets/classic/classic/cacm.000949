Integer and Signed Constants in ALGOL
A few remarks are given on the relations between
syntax and semantics in the programming languages. 
 The aim is to point out that, if it is true that the grammar
of a context-free language should be conceived 
not only as a strings-generating device but also as a
method for expressing a meaning, then the grammar 
of ALGOL is open to some criticism.
