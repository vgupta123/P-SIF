Strategic Considerations in the Design of a Screening System for
Substructure Searches of Chemical Structure Files
  A major problem in the design of screening systems for substructure searches
of chemical structure files is the development of a methodology for selection of
an optimal set of structural characteristics to act as screens.  The set chosen
for a particular application will depend on the characteristics of the
collection, as well as on its size and growth rate.  A strategy which takes
account of the disparate frequencies of the various species of fragments
in a data-base by use of differential, and, in part, hierarchical levels of
description is detailed.  The distributions of a variety of structural
characteristics, including bond-centered, atom-centered, and ring fragments
in a 30,000-compound sample of the Chemical Abstracts Service Registry System
are summarized.  Implementation of the approach, using primarily bond-centered
fragments, by means of simple and highly efficient computer programs, is
detailed.
