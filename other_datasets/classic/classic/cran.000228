navier-stokes solutions at large distances from a finite body .
this paper is concerned with a theoretical investigation of the flow
field at large distances from an object moving through a viscous fluid .
the discussion will be restricted to the case of two-dimensional
stationary incompressible flow .  the object will be assumed to be of
finite size .  the domain of the fluid is infinite and it is assumed
that there are no other boundaries for the fluid except that of the
given object .  the reynolds number will be assumed to have a fixed
value., thus we shall not consider the limiting cases of the reynolds
number tending to zero or to infinity .
