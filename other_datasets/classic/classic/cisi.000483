Performance of Automatic Information Systems
   The SMART document retrieval system is used to investigate algorithms for
text analysis and request searching.. Results from three document collections 
indicate that word normalization is efficiently performed by automatic thesaurus
lookup, while phrase matching procedures, statistical association methods, and 
concept hierarchies are useful for special applications.. Automatic document 
clustering schemes and use-interactive feedback methods permit rapid searches of
large collections.. Abstracts are found to be superior to titles as a base for
content analysis in a document retrieval system and almost as good as complete
texts.. Proper procedures for designing dictionaries and searching requests
are discussed..The practicality of large scale document centers and their proper
design are considered in light of these results..
