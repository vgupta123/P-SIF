wind tunnel techniques for the measurements of oscillatory
derivatives .
this paper discusses the basic principles employed in techniques for the
 measurement of oscillatory derivatives in wind tunnels, and gives some
account of the associated instrumentation . the suitability of the
various techniques for different test conditions is also discussed and
brief reference is made to wind tunnel effects on the measurements .
