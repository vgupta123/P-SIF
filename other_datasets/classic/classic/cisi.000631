A General Statistical Model for Estimating Future Demand Levels of Data-Base
Utilization Within an Information Retrieval Organization
   A statistical model for characterizing the growth patterns of data base
utilization and for estimating future utilization levels of demand has been
developed for information retrieval organizations.. The model developed is
y = b( 1 - e(**-at) ) where y is the number of users of a data base at time t,
and a and b are parameters to be estimated.. Illustrations of the model applied 
to a typical information retrieval organization are given and discussed..
