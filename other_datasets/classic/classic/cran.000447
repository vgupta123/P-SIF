motion of thin bodies in a highly rarefied plasma .
motion of thin bodies in a highly rarefied plasma .
  magnetic effects are considered negligible,
and the velocity of the body is in a range between the
electron and positive ion thermal speeds .
the self-consistent field approach is used in which the
electron distribution is assumed to be maxwellian,
while the positive ion distribution function is given
by the /collision-free/ boltzmann equation .
it is assumed that the ion reflection at the body surface
is specular, and the body is sufficiently thin so
that the ion distribution function is a small perturbation
of a maxwellian distribution .  the solution for
the simple case of a dielectric body with a given surface
charge, as well as some general properties to
be expected for a conducting body are given .
