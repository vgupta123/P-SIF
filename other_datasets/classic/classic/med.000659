at present, six distinct species of mycoplasmas
are known to infect man.  certain biological and
ecological properties of these agents have been
defined.  one species, m. pneumoniae, has been
definitely shown to be an important respiratory-
tract pathogen, and another species, m. hominis
type 1, may play a role in respiratory-tract and
genital-tract disease.
