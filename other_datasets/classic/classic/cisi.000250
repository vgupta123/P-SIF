Centralized Processing for Academic Libraries; final report of the
Colorado Academic Libraries Book Processing Center; the first six
months of operation
    This is the final report of the Colorado Academic
Libraries Book Processing Center (CALBPC)
project.  The CALBPC project was begun in 1965
by nine academic libraries in Colorado in an effort
to establish a centralized acquisition and processing
center.  The report of Phase I-II, completed
in June 1968, dealt primarily with a general feasibility
study, the design of the central system, costs
of acquiring and processing in nine libraries and a
number of related concerns such as accounting, the
congruence of approval plans and user attitudes toward
library services.
    This report focuses on the experimental operations
which were concluded officially on September 30,
1969.  Whereas the Phase I-II study dealt with the
theory and principles upon which a system might
be based, we are presently concerned with the
pragmatics of book processing, the obstacles 
encountered, and the solutions achieved.
    Although this report deals primarily with
cooperative acquisitions and processing, we believe
it also contributes to a better understanding of
cooperative programs.  The experiment was designed
to monitor operations throughout the acquisition/
cataloging cycle.  Performance and cost measurements
were made on most internal and external aspects
of the system.  Monitoring also extended into
the participating libraries where a product
acceptance study was conducted.  A secondary
objective of the project was to observe the 
relationships which formed between the participants
and the central agency, such as the interface of
systems and the human interaction of participants
and the Center.
