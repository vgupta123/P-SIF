Computers as an Innovation in American Local Governments
Computers and electronic data processing are
a major technological innovation in the operations 
of American local government. This paper establishes that
there is substantial variation among the larger 
local governments in the rate at which they adopt computer
technology, in the level of financial support 
they provide for EDP, and in the extensiveness and sophistication
of their automated applications.  The 
central question addressed is: What might explain the
differences between governments in the extent to 
which they adopt and use computers?  Hypotheses are
tested for several streams of explanatory factors, 
using data from more than 500 city and county governments.
 The findings identify certain local government 
milieus which are particularly conducive to higher levels
of computer innovation.  Somewhat unexpected 
findings reveal the significant impact of the distribution
of control over EDP decisions and the dominant 
political values within the government. Other important
factors include the measured need for computer 
applications and the presence of external funding support
for computing.  Finally, the paper suggests 
a framework for identifying the key determinants
of other technological innovations.
