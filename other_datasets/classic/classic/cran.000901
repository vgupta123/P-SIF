long slender delta wings with leading edge separation .
  the slender-body approximation of linearized compressible flow is
applied to the problem of a delta wing in which flow separation occurs
at the leading edges .  the vortex sheets found in the real flow are
approximated by concentrated vortices with feeding lattices, and a
plausible adaptation of kelvin's theorem is applied to simulate the
force-free nature of the vortex sheet .
  the computations show that leading-edge separation produces an
increase in lift over that given by the jones slender-wing theory and
that the lift does not vary linearly with angle of attack .  computed
pressure distributions and span loadings are presented and the
theoretical lift results are compared with the results of simple force tests
made at a mach number of 1.9 .
