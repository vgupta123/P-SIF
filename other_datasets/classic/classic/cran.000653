transient magnetohydrodynamic duct flow .
  parallel flow of an electrically conducting viscous
incompressible fluid in a rectangular duct with
transverse magnetic field is considered .  the walls
of the duct which are parallel and perpendicular
to the imposed magnetic field are taken to be
nonconducting and perfectly conducting, respectively .
assuming the fluid to be at rest at the initial
moment, exact solutions for the velocity and magnetic
field components are obtained in the form of
convolution integrals taking the longitudinal pressure
gradient as an arbitrary given function of time .
later, taking a step function for the pressure gradient,
these expressions are integrated .  for this case,
the effect of the strength of the imposed magnetic
field on the development behavior of the flow is
studied .  it is found that except for very large magnetic
fields, the flows are over damped .
