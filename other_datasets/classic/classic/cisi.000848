A Book Catalog at Stanford
   Description of a system for the production of a book catalog for an 
undergraduate library, using an IBM 1401 Computer (12K storage, 4 tape drives),
an expanded print chain on the 1403 Printer, and an 029 Card Punch for input..
Described are the conversion of cataloging information into machine readable 
form, the machine record produced, the computer programs employed, and printing 
of the catalog.. The catalog, issued annually, is in three parts: an author
title catalog, a subject catalog, and a shelf list.. Cumulative supplements are 
issued quarterly.. A central idea in the depiction of entries in the catalog is 
the abandonment of the main entry concept.. The alphabetical arrangement of 
entries is discussed: sort keys employed, filing order observed, symbols 
employed to alter this order, and problems encountered.. Cost factors involved 
in the preparation of the catalog are summarized..
