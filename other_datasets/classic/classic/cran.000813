the motion of rolling symmetrical missiles referred
to a body-axis system .
  the linearized equations of motion have been derived for a rolling
missile having slight aerodynamic asymmetries .  time histories of
rolling-missile motions referred to a body-axis system have been
prepared to show the types of missile motions that can be encountered .
the motions resulting from a trim change and a pulse-rocket disturbance
are shown to be determined mainly by the ratio of rolling velocity to
pitching frequency .
  finally, the derived equations are used in establishing a technique
for the reduction of rolling-missile oscillation data .  it is shown
that the aerodynamic derivatives can be obtained from flight data if
four accelerations are measured .  the method is applied to the results
obtained from a flight test of a missile configuration .
