integration of the boundary layer equations .
integration of the boundary layer equations .
the equations of the boundary layer
are integrated by an expression of the form
where f(x) is a positive function with x=0
as the stationary point,. (x) is slowly varying,.
the integral contains an unknown parameter
which is found from the condition .
  the integral is evaluated by the method of
steepest descent .  the expressions obtained are
usually divergent, except in few cases which
include blasius's equation,. the divergent
expressions are summed by euler's transformation .
  to check the procedure it is applied to falkner
and skan's equation .  the results obtained
are very striking,. few terms in the expansions
are sufficient to obtain close agreement with
hartree's laborious numerical computations .
  the method is also applied to the general
boundary-layer equation for the case of flow past
an elliptic cylinder, measured by schubauer .
the results obtained are in close agreement
with schubauer's measurements for the velocities,
almost up to separation, for the position of
the separation point,. and in satisfactory agreement downstream of
separation .
