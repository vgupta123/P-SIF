stability equations for conical shells .
  the author rewrites v. s. vlasov's equations for (linear)
stability theory of shells (prikl. mat. meh. 8(1944),
109-placements .  the result is a single eighth-order equation
for normal deflection, and two fourth-order equations
relating the displacement components in the shell middle
surface to the normal displacement .
