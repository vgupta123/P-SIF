Machine Controls for Analysis of Variance
A major problem in using the analysis of variance,
as the number of factors increases, is the 
exponential rise in the number of interactions.  Even
though the experimenter may not be interested in 
these interactions it is impossible to ignore them in
most experimental designs because of the problem 
of getting error terms.  It is natural therefore to look
to the computer to handle the bulk of work involved 
in computing the interactions.  A program device
to get the computer to do this is described.
