An Extensible Editor for a Small Machine with Disk Storage
A design philosophy for developing a sophisticated
utility program is illustrated by the actual 
design and implementation of a text editor.  A versatile
data structure is employed so that only a small 
number of programmed subroutines are necessary for all
types of data manipulation.  Such a data structure 
is described, and its merits are illustrated by the ease
with which powerful extensions can be implemented 
in terms of a few basic editing function.
