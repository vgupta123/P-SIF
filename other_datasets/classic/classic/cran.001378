blunt-cone pressure distributions at hypersonic mach numbers .
the static pressure distributions on the surface of a
blunted 7.5 degree-half-angle cone have recently been experimentally
determined in the cal 48 inch hypersonic shock tunnel .  this
facility and the associated instrumentation are described in detail
in ref. 1 .  these tests covered a mach number range of 8 to 18
at a reynolds number per foot of approximately 1 times 10 to the 5th
power., the models included one flat-faced cone and two hemispherically
blunted cones .
