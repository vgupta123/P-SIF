Graph Model for Library Information Networks
   The design and study of library information networks are enhanced by the use 
of the concepts which have been developed by graph theorists.. In this paper we
expand upon this theme, proposing a general network structure which we believe
to be a good model for a wide variety of library and other information 
networks.. The basic concepts from graph theory are illustrated with the aid of 
a hypothetical Public Library Access Network (PLAN)..
