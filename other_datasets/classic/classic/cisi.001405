Techniques of Information Retrieval
  Information retrieval is now an accepted part of the new discipline of
information science and technology, and its principles are taught not only in
librarianship and documentation, but also in courses of systems design.
There are half a dozen useful texts available, each with a special emphasis
arising from the varied backgrounds and interests of the authors.
