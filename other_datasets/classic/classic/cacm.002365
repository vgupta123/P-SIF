Matrix Computations with Fortran and Paging
The efficiency of conventional Fortran programs
for matrix computations can often be improved 
by reversing the order of nested loops.  Such modifications
produce modest savings in many common situations 
and very significant savings for large problems run
under an operating system which uses paging.
