A Bounded Storage Algorithm for Copying Cyclic Structures
A new algorithm is presented which copies cyclic
list structures using bounded workspace and 
linear time. Unlike a previous similar algorithm, this
one makes no assumptions about the storage allocation 
system in use and uses only operations likely to be available
in a high-level language.  The distinctive 
feature of this algorithm is a technique for traversing
the structure twice, using the same spanning 
tree in each case, first from left to right and then from right to left.
