waves in supersonic flow .
waves in supersonic flow .
in this chapter we shall mainly consider problems of steady, two-
dimensional (plane) supersonic flow .  using the fact that in this case
there is a steady wave system, we shall find solutions by an indirect
approach .  that is, we shall first study the conditions under which
simple stationary waves may exist in the flow, and then find the flow
boundaries to which they correspond or which may be fitted to
them .  in this procedure the limited upstream influence in a supersonic
field is very helpful, for it allows flows to be analyzed or
constructed step by step, which is a method that is not possible in
the subsonic case .
