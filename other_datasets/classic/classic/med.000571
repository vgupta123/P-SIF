influence of alloxan diabetes on
growth hormone content of the rat hypophysis
homog-
enates of adenophypophysial tissue obtained from alloxan-
injected adult male rats varying in duration and severity of
diabetes, as well as from diabetic rats maintained on an
insulin replacement regimen, were assayed in immature
hypophysectomized female rats.  the ability of these crude
hypophysial extracts to encourage tibial cartilage width ex-
pansion gain in body weight, and to depress hematocrit and
blood area levels was determined.  significant decrements in
ability to increase epiphysial cartilage width and ability to
depress hematocrits were noted 14 to 28 days following injection
of alloxan.  increasing the intensity of the diabetic state was
associated with decreased growth-promoting potency of hypo-
physial preparations as well as with decreased ability to
influence the hematological indices.  hypophysial extracts taken
from insulin-treated diabetic rats contained more growth
hormone than equivalent amounts of tissue obtained from
control rats.  it is concluded that the adenohypophyses of
diabetic rats contain diminished amounts of growth hormone
and the insulin repairs or encourages greater than normal ac-
cumulation of somatotrophin in these animals.
