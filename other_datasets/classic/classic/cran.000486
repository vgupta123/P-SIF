similarity laws for aerothermoelastic testing .
  the similarity laws for aerothermoelastic testing are presented
in the range .  these are obtained by
making nondimensional the appropriate governing equations of
the individual external aerodynamic flow, heat conduction to
the interior, and stress-deflection problems which make up the
combined aerothermoelastic problem .
  for the general aerothermoelastic model, where the model is
placed in a high-stagnation-temperature wind tunnel, similitude
is shown to be very difficult to achieve for a scale ratio other
than unity .  the primary conflict occurs between the
free-stream mach number reynolds number aeroelastic
parameter heat conduction parameter and
thermal expansion parameter .
  means of dealing with this basic conflict are presented .  these
include (1) looking at more specialized situations, such as the
behavior of wing structures and of thin solid plate lifting surfaces,
and panel flutter, where the aerothermoelastic similarity
parameters assume less restrictive forms, (2) the use of /incomplete
aerothermoelastic/ testing in which the pressure and/or heating
rates are estimated in advance and applied artificially to the
model, and (3) the use of /restricted purpose/ models
investigating separately one or another facet of the complete
aerothermoelastic problem .
  some numerical examples of modeling for the general
aerothermoelastic case as well as for the specialized situations
mentioned in (1) above are given .
  finally, extension of the aerothermoelastic similarity laws to
higher speeds and temperatures is discussed .
