a refinement of the linearised transonic flow theory .
  a new method is proposed to calculate the velocity and pressure
distributions around a thin symmetrical aerofoil or a slender body of
revolution flying at transonic speed .  it is essentially a refinement
of the linearized transonic flow theory due to oswatitsch and maeder,
such that a correction term is introduced to take account of the
nonlinear character of the transonic flow .  as examples of application,
a symmetrical circular-arc aerofoil and a circular-arc body of
revolution in the sonic flow are dealt with, and the results are found
to be in good agreement with experiments, except for the rear portion in
the latter case .
