A Practical Method for Constructing LR(k) Processors
A practical method for constructing LR(k) processors
is developed.  These processors are capable 
of recognizing and parsing an input during a single
no-backup scan in a number of steps equal to the 
length of the input plus the number of steps in its
derivation.  The technique presented here is based 
on the original method described by Knuth, but decreases
both the effort required to construct the processor 
and the size of the processor produced.  This procedure
involves partitioning the given grammar into 
a number of smaller parts.  If an LR(k) processor can be
constructed for each part (using Knuth's algorithm) 
and if certain conditions relating these individual
processors are satisfied, then an LR(k) processor 
for the entire grammar can be constructed for them.
 Using this procedure, an LR(1) parser for ALGOL 
has been obtained.
