New Methods to Color the Vertices of a Graph
This paper describes efficient new heuristic
methods to color the vertices of a graph which rely
upon the comparison of the degrees and structure of a graph.  A method
is developed which is exact for bipartite graphs and is an
important part of heuristic procedures to find maximal cliques in general
graphs.  Finally an exact method is given which performs better
than the Randall-Brown algorithm and is able to color larger
graphs, and the new heuristic methods, the classical methods, and
the exact method are compared.
