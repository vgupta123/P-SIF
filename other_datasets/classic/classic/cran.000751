a note on the use of end plates to prevent three dimensional
flow at the ends of bluff cylinders .
  the results are given of
some observations of the effects of
end plates on the three-dimensional
separated flow at the ends of
cylindrical models .  while these are
by no means exhaustive, it is felt
that they are of sufficient interest
to merit putting on record .
