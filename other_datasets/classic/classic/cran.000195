correlation of theoretical and photo-thermoelastic
results on thermal stresses in idealized wing structure .
after a rather complete exploratory program
described in previous papers, the
photo-thermoelastic method was applied to the
experimental evaluation of the thermal-stress
theories .  the new technique was correlated
with several theories which analyzed the
transient thermal stresses in idealized wing
structures of high-speed aircraft .  various
theories were investigated which represented
the same idealized wing models and
differed from each other only in the simplifying
assumptions regarding the temperature
distributions in skin and webs .  the theories
were evaluated by duplicating the boundary
and initial conditions on plastic models and
then by correlating the theories with the
observed fringe orders in nondimensional form .
a significant general conclusion was
reached after correlating the available theories
and experimental results .  owing to
simplifying assumptions concerning the thermal
behavior in the flanges, thermal
stresses predicted by the available theories are all
higher than the experimental
observation .  in some cases the discrepancy is as great as 30 per cent .
