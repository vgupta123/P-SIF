Professionalism Reconsidered
   The question of librarianship as a profession is considered here in terms of 
the three key relationships of a professional-client, organizational and 
professional.. Professional practice in this field is thus cast against 
accepted norms and standards of professional behavior.. This critical 
assessment suggests that librarianship falls far short of the professional 
model.. Major shifts in the nature of the services performed by librarians
and in their bureaucratic relationships will be required if librarianship is to
advance.. The contributions of the professional associations and of library
schools to the advancement of the process of professionalization is also 
analyzed.. Progress in the field is viewed to be inextricably tied to the 
success or failure which librarianship achieves in its quest for true 
professional attainment..
