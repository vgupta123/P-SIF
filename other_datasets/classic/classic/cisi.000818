Progress in Documentation:
Research in User Behaviour in University Libraries
  The task of the librarian is to achieve his library's objectives.  A
simplistic statement, perhaps, but it is rare that a library's objectives
are defined in any terms other than the broadest - for example, 'to meet
the needs of its users'.  In fact, the definition of objectives in any
service organization is likely to be an iterative process, but the
explicit commitment to users' needs (however mystical this concept may
be) requires the librarian to examine users' behaviour as a first step
to determining policy.  Since a complete state-of-the-art in user 
behaviour would fill a substantial book, this survey is restricted to
drawing together some threads of research of potential application in
university libraries.  Methodological problems are not discussed here,
since these are adequately reviewed elsewhere.
