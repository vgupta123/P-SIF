Spelling Correction in Systems Programs
Several specialized techniques are shown for efficiently
incorporating spelling correction algorithms in
to compilers and operating systems.  These include the use of syntax
and semantics information, the organization of restricted keyword
and symbol tables, and the consideration of a limited class of spelling
errors.  Sample 360 coding for performing spelling correction
is presented.  By using systems which perform spelling correction,
the number of debugging runs per program has been decreased,
saving both programmer and machine time.
