clues in dealing with
cancer patients
it is clear that the patient with cancer changed
his pattern of communication at different stages of
the disease.  these patterns in communication were
the basis or clues for the doctor and paramedical
personnel to consider in making total care more
effective.  the bedside clinician of past days knew
these clues instinctively in his wise ministrations.
thanks to a gifted social worker these have been
now made manifest to help all of us in dealing
with cancer and perhaps other chronic relentless
diseases.
