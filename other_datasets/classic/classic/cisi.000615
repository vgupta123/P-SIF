A Cost Model for Evaluating Information Retrieval Systems    
   This paper develops a mathematical model for use in studying how to 
minimize the cost of operating a mechanized retrieval system.. Through 
the use of cost analysis, the model provides a method for comparative
evaluation between information retrieval systems.. The cost model divides the
costs of a retrieval system into two components:  system costs and user costs..
In addition, it suggests that a trade off exists between the performance
level of the system and the combination of user and systems time that is
expended in working with the system.. This minimizes the total cost of
operating the system.. The allocation is done for a given performance level
and for a given cost per unit of user and system time..
