On a Class of Skew Distribution Functions
  It is the purpose of this paper to analyse a class of distribution
functions that appears in a wide range of empirical data - particularly
data describing sociological, biological and economic phenomena.  Its
appearance is so frequent, and the phenomena in which it appears so diverse,
that one is led to the conjecture that if these phenomena have any property
in common it can only be a similarity in the structure of the underlying 
probability mechanisms.  The empirical distributions to which we shall refer
specifically are: (A) distributions of words in prose samples by their
frequency of occurrence, (B) distributions of scientists by number of papers
published, (C) distributions of cities by population, (D) distributions of
incomes by size, and (E) distributions of biological generally by number of
species.
