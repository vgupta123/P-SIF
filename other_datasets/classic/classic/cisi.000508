Interactive Reference Retrieval in Large Files
   We express the conviction that on-line reference retrieval will largely 
replace the present tape driven system in a few years.. We describe the design
criteria of such an on-line system based on our experience of a pilot system 
which has been operational for 2 years, emphasizing the importance of
minimizing the number of disk accesses.. We recommend the use of hash coding 
for searching in a thesaurus and point out that the user of an on-line system 
should use the most precise terms first and the common terms last - the 
opposite of the procedure in a manual search..
