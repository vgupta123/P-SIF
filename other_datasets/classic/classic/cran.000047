analysis of low-aspect-ratio aircraft structures .
  two methods are presented for the analysis of complex low-
aspect-ratio aircraft structures .  both methods provide for
arbitrary external loading, are general with respect to the
orientation of structural members, and permit arbitrary boundary
conditions .  for purposes of analysis a structure is idealized as a
network of flexural members with interconnected torsion boxes .
  in the first method, sets of linear equations are obtained by
expressing boundary conditions, member deflection equations,
equilibrium requirements, and slope-compatibility relationships
in terms of deflections and internal forces .  the solution for
deflections and internal forces is then formed as the product of an
inverse structural matrix and a column matrix of load functions .
  in the second method, the conditions at a given boundary are
assembled as a column matrix and are transferred in a step
by-step fashion over the entire structure to an opposite boundary .
the transfer is accomplished by successive multiplications of
square matrices composed independently for the different
transfer ranges .  the final operation is the inversion of a relatively
small matrix and provides the solution for the unknown boundary
conditions .
  comparisons of theoretical results with experimental data and
electric-analog solutions are favorable .
