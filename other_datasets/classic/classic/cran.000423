an experimental investigation of the flow over blunt-nosed
cones at a mach number of 5. 8.
  shock shapes were observed and static pressures were measured
on spherically-blunted cones at a nominal mach number of 5.8 over a
range of reynolds numbers per inch from 97,000 to 238,000, for angles
of yaw from 0 to 8 .  six combinations of the bluntness ratios 0.4, 0.8,
and 1.064 with the cone half angles 10, 20, and 40 were used in
determining the significant parameters governing pressure distribution .
  the pressure distribution on the spherical nose for both yawed
and unyawed bodies is predicted quite accurately by the modified
newtonian theory given by, where is the angle between the
normal to a surface element and the flow direction ahead of the bow
shock .  cone half angle was found to be the significant parameter in
determining the pressure distribution near the nose-cone junction and
over the conical afterbody .  on the 40 spherical nosed cone models
the flow overexpanded with respect to the taylor-maccoll pressure in
the region of the spherical-conical juncture, after which the pressure
returned rapidly to the taylor-maccoll value .  for models with smaller
cone angles the region of minimum pressure occurred farther back on
the conical portion of the model, and the taylor-maccoll pressure was
approached more gradually .  the shape of the pressure distributions
as described in nondimensional coordinates was independent of the
radius of the spherical nose and of the reynolds number over the range
of reynolds number per inch between .97 x 10 and 2.38 x 10 .
  integrated results for the pressure foredrag of the models at zero
yaw compared very closely with the predictions of the modified newtonian
approximation, except for models with large cone angles and small nose
radii, where the drag approaches the value given by the taylor-maccoll
theory for sharp cones .
