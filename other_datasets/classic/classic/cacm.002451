Design of Tree Structures for Efficient Querying
A standard information retrieval operation is
to determine which records in a data collection 
satisfy a given query expressed in terms of data values.
 The process of locating the desired responses 
can be represented by a tree search model.  This paper
poses an optimization problem in the design of 
such trees to serve a well-specified application. The
problem is academic in the sense that ordinarily 
the optimal tree cannot be implemented by means of practical
techniques.  On the other hand, it is potentially 
useful for the comparison it affords between observed
performance and that of an intuitively attractive 
ideal search procedure.  As a practical application
of such a model this paper considers the design of 
a novel tree search scheme based on a bit vector representation
of data and shows that essentially the 
same algorithm can be used to design either an ideal
search tree or a bit-vector tree.  An experimental 
study of a small formatted file illustrates the concepts.
