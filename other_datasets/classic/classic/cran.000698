the unsteady lift of a wing of finite aspect ratio .
unsteady-lift functions for wings of finite aspect ratio have been
calculated by correcting the aerodynamic inertia and the angle of attack of
 the infinite wing . the calculations are based on the operational
method .
the starting lift of the finite wing is found to be only slightly less
than that of the infinite wing,. whereas the final lift may be
considerably less . the theory indicates that the initial distribution of
lift is similar to the final distribution .
curves showing the variation of lift after a sudden unit change in angle
 of attack, during penetration of a sharpedge gust, and during a
continuous oscillation are given . operational equivalents of these
functions have been devised to facilitate the calculation of lift under
various conditions of motion . as an application of these formulas, the
vertical acceleration of a loaded wing caused by penetrating a gust has
been calculated .
