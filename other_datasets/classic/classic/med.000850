studies on compensatory renal hypertrophy.  i.  effect of
unilateral ureteral ligation and transection
data are presented comparing the relative rate
of compensatory renal hypertrophy
and hyperplasia of the control kidney of rats
following either unilateral ureteral
transection, ligation, or nephrectomy.  the growth
of the control kidney on the unoperated
side was strikingly slower after ureteral
transection and ligation when
compared with that resulting from the removal
of one kidney.  progressive hydronephrosis
was observed on the operated side following
ureteral transection and
ligation and was more pronounced in the latter.
degree of hypertrophy of the control
kidney showed a close correlation with degree and
duration of the hydronephrosis of
the kidney on the operated side.  these observations
have been interpreted as indicating
the operation of a control system regulating
kidney growth in response to
changes in some way related to kidney size.
