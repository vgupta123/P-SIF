design of stiffened cylinders in axial compression .
  the problem of optimum design
of axially compressed cylinders
stiffened by rings and stringers is
discussed .  particular
attention is devoted to configurations
suitable for large launch
vehicles .  consideration is given to
the analytical techniques for
determining strength as well as
the procedures for optimization .
