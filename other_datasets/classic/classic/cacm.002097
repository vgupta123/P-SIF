A Program to Teach Programming
The TEACH system was developed at MIT to ease the cost and improve the results 
of elementary instruction in programming.  To the student, TEACH offers loosely 
guided experience with a  conversational language which was designed with
teaching in mind.  Faculty involvement is minimal.  A term of experience
with TEACH is discussed.  Pedagogically, the system appears to be successful; 
straightforward reimplementation will make it economically successful as well. 
Similar programs of profound tutorial skill will appear only as the results of
extended research.  The outlines of his research are beginning to become clear.
