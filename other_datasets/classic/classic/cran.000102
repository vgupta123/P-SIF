advantages and limitations of models .
summary ..  the use of models for structural test investigations in the
presence of kinetic heating effects is examined .  the principal
features of the complex process to be
represented are discussed under the classifications
external air flow, internal heat transfer,
elastic response .  of these the second is found
to influence most model design, and an
analysis of a typical structure is included to
illustrate the various contributions to
internal heat transfer .
