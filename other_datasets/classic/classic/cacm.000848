A Note on Range Transformations for Square Root and Logarithm
There was the germ of an idea in two previous
papers [1,2] which no one seems to have picked 
up in almost five years.  For certain functions it seems
desirable to transform the argument to a short 
range symmetric about 10.1 will give examples of this
usage for the square root and logarithm function 
for both binary and decimal machines.
