slender delta wings with sharp edges at zero lift .
  several slender wings of delta planform with sharp edges have been
investigated theoretically at zero lift at subsonic and at supersonic
speeds .  most of the wings have diamond-shaped cross sections and are
intended to lead to a type of flow with leading-edge separation in the
lifting condition .  the pressure distributions and overall
normal-pressure drags resulting from various theoretical methods are compared
with one another and some discussion is included concerning the
possibility of achieving the results, calculated for an inviscid stream,
in a real flow in the presence of a viscous layer around the body .
