A Highly Associative Document Retrieval System
   This paper describes a document retrieval system implemented with a subset of 
the medical literature.. With the exception of the development of a negative
dictionary, all system operations are completely automatic.. Introduced are
methods for computation of term-term association factors, indexing, assignment
of term-document relevance values, and computations for recall and relevance..
High weights are provided for low-frequency terms, and retrieval is performed 
directly from highly connected term-document files without elaboration.. Recall 
and relevance are based on quantitative internal system computations, and 
results are compared with user evaluations..
