Gauss Harmonic Interpolation Formulas
Let R be an open, bounded, simply connected
region in the (x,y)-plane and let (x*,y*) be a 
point in R.  Assuming R is starlike with respect to
(x*,y*), we discuss a method for computing Gauss 
harmonic interpolation formulas for R and the point (x*,y*).
 Such formulas approximate a harmonic function 
at (x*,y*) in terms of a linear combination of its
values at certain selected points on the boundary 
of R.  Such formulas are useful for approximating
the solution of the Dirichlet problem for R.
