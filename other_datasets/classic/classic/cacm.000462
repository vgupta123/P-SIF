Computer Pattern Recognition Techniques: Electrocardiographic Diagnosis
The use of programmed digital computers as general
pattern classification and recognition devices 
is one phase of the current lively interest in artificial
intelligence.  It is important to choose a 
class of signals which is, at present, undergoing a
good deal of visual inspection by trained people 
for the purpose of pattern recognition.  In this way
comparisons between machine and human performance 
may be obtained.  A practical result also serves as additional
motivation.  Clinical electrocardiograms 
make up such a class of signals.  The approach to the
problem presented here centers upon the use of 
multiple adaptive matched filters that classify normalized
signals.  The present report fives some of 
the background for the application of this method.
