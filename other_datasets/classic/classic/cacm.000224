Sequential Formula Translation
The syntax of an algorithmic language such
as ALGOL is conveniently described as a sequence 
of states indicated by an element called cellar.  Transitions
are controlled by admissible state-symbol 
pairs which may be represented by a transition matrix.
This description of syntax furnishes at the same 
time an extremely simple rule for translating into machine
programs statements in the algorithmic language. 
 Sequential treatment, however, is not feasible in the case
of certain optimizing processes such as recursive 
address calculation.
