boundary-value problems of the thin-walled circular
cylinder .
boundary-value problems of the thin-walled circular
cylinder .
  the homogeneous differential equations of donnell's
theory of thin cylindrical shells are integrated .
expressions are obtained in closed form for the displacements,
membrane stresses, moments, and shear forces .
