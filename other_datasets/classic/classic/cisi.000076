Biomedical Literature: Analysis of Journal Articles 
  Collected by a Radiation- and Cell-Biologist
   The author's journal reference cards for 1965 and 1966 were analyzed 
according to three "interest patterns": (I) the total collection of 1469 
article titles, a "potentially useful" set; (II) a subset concerning only his
research speciality; and (III) a subset of articles defined as "useful". For
each pattern, journals were ranked by frequency of use and a scatter diagram 
was drawn..
   Patterns I and II largely resembled patterns obtained by counting citations
in basic journals or by counting publications of selected researchers.. Pattern 
III was more widely scattered..  It is concluded that access to diverse 
journals is needed by researchers to supply new ideas, and that this diversity 
of reading is not reflected adequately by citation counting or other indirect 
means..
   Current Contents, used by the author for current-awareness purposes in 
building his card file, generated 88% of all articles.. Scatter diagrams 
indicated the decreased scatter predicted from its use..
   The 30% most important journals in this collection, including about 80% of
titles, are ranked for each pattern..
