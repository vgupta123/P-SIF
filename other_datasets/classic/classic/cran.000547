boundary layer characteristics of caret wings .
  the theory of laminar boundary
layers along flat surfaces has been
used in conjunction with eckert's
approximations to the displacement
thickness, skin friction and temperature
profiles on the undersurface of a
caret wing configuration .  to a first
approximation it has been assumed
that parallel flow exits behind the shock
outside the boundary layer, and the
displacement of the shock by the boundary
layer near the leading edge is neglected .
  conduction of heat within the
body and along the surface is neglected
but radiation is included, so that
are found .  examples are given for
various altitudes and configurations and
the effect of the skin friction on
the lift drag ratio calculated, assuming
the undersurfaces to be plane .
