influence of the leading-edge shock wave on the laminar boundary layer
at hypersonic speeds .
in order to bring out the importance of the leading-edge region at
hypersonic speeds, the influence of the leading-edge shock wave on
the laminar boundary layer is investigated in two simple cases of
steady flow over a semi-infinite, insulated flat plate..  (1) sharp
leading edge., (2) blunt leading edge, as approximated by a normal
shock wave .  the streamlines that enter the boundary layer over a large
region of the plate surface has previously crossed the shock wave
very near the leading-edge, where the shock is strong and highly
curved .  consequently, the temperature at the outer edge of the
boundary layer is appreciably higher than free-stream temperature,
and the vorticity there is not zero .  the effects of this shock-wave
larger than the usual /errors/ made in the boundary-layer theory,
and an estimate of these effects can therefore be obtained within the
framework of that theory .  the numerical magnitude of the shock-wave
influence is found to be appreciable .  for the case of the blunt
leading edge the slope of the curve of induced pressures plotted against
the hypersonic interaction parameter closely approaches the experimental
data of hammitt and bogdonoff obtained in helium at large values of this
parameter .  these approximate results show that the influence of the
leading-edge region at hypersonic speeds requires careful theoretical
and experimental study .
