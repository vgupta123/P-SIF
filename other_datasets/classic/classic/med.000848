the regulation of growth hormone secretion
in the present communication we summarize
our investigations on the control
of secretion of hgh using radioimmunoassay
for the measurement of plasma
gh. the assumption, implied throughout this
presentation, that changes in
secretory rate are responsible for acute
changes in plasma concentration of
hgh appears reasonable since the
fluctuations in plasma hgh concentration
are often too rapid to be caused solely by
alterations in hormonal
degradation or excretion.  for slower changes
in plasma hgh concentration,
however, alterations in the rate of removal
of hormone from the body fluids
might play a contributory role.  however,
there is no evidence that important
changes occur in the rate of removal of
hgh from the circulation except in
patients who have developed antibodies
to hgh following treatment with hgh.
