the motion of a viscous liquid past a paraboloid .
  an approximate solution for the steady
flow of incompressible viscous liquid past
a paraboloid of revolution is described .
an assumption is made for the form of the
stokes stream function and substituted
into the navier-stokes equations using
paraboloidal coordinates .  after making
suitable approximations, a non-linear
differential equation for a function f is
deduced .  the solutions of this equation
depend on the reynolds number of the
flow considered .  examples found by
numerical integration are given to illustrate
the properties of the function f for
reynolds numbers varying from 0.0001 to
is found, and it is shown that this approximate
solution tends to the perfect fluid
flow away from the boundary, allowance
being made for the displacement effect of
what may be called the boundary layer .
