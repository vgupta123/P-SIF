An Introduction to Computers in Information Science
        This book is an introduction to the field of information science
and technology, with particular emphasis on document organization.
Its point of view is general in the sense that it attempts to deal with
types of problems rather than particular systems.  When particular
systems are described they are used as examples of systems rather
than as models.
        The method of presentation is expository at the introductory
level.  While differing points of view are frequently noted, this book
is not intended to provide definitive critical evaluation.  Relevant
research is reviewed in order to indicate current thinking and activities
in the field.
