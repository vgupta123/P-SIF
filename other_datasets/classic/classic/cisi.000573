Ascertaining Activities in a Subject Area Through Bibliometric Analysis
   A combination of quantitative and qualitative analyses were used on the
journal articles indexed in one volume of Library Literature.. Findings
include: the dispersion of a articles among journals followed a Bradford-type
distribution except for a "collapse" at the end, possibly showing low level of
interaction of librarianship with other fields; considerable proportion of
articles was of news-type; administration was the largest single subject 
covered.. The methodology may be appropriate for analysis of activities in 
other fields..
