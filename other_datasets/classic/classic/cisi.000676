ISI's Experiences with ASCA - A Selective Dissemination System
  ASCA (Automatic Subject Citation Alert) is a commercially available SDI
system covering the journal literature.  The repertoire of questions which
ASCA can utilize includes cited references, words from titles, authors,
organizations, etc., and allows for logical combinations of these questions.
This paper discusses differences and similarities between "citations" and
"words" in retrieving and disseminating information.  The problem of user-
system interaction is explored, and some techniques for developing effective
interest profiles are described.  Although ASCA is a multi-disciplinary system,
examples from fields like synthetic chemistry and biochemistry are provided.
