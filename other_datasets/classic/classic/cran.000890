comments on 'thermal buckling of clamped cylindrical shells' .
in the recent paper by zuk, an expression was presented for
the critical buckling temperature of a clamped cylindrical shell
in terms of the material and geometrical properties of the shell .
restraint at the edges of the shell was assumed to be provided by
rigid frames experiencing no temperature rise .
the circumferential stress induced in the shell when it experienced
a temperature rise, t, may be approximated by the function .
in other words, there is a compressive circumferential stress along
the entire length, l, of the shell .
it is well known, however, that the discontinuity stresses introduced at
the junction of a shell and a rigid frame (or bulk-head) are extremely
localized, and the circumferential stresses induced in the shell
decrease rapidly away from the joint .
