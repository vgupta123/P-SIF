note on the hypersonic similarity law for an unyawed
cone .
  it is now known that the hypersonic similarity law derived for
slender cones and ogival bodies under the assumption, is
applicable for mach numbers as low as 3 .  this note makes use of
a series development to infer the hypersonic similarity law for
unyawed cones from the taylor-maccoll differential equations and
associated boundary conditions .  a simple approximate formula
for the function of the similarity law is obtained,
and the drag function computed with this formula is compared
with kopal's numerical results and, for very slender cones, with
von karman's linearized formula .
