RELEVANCE: A Review of and a Framework for the Thinking on the Notion 
in Information Science
   Information science emerged as the third subject, along with logic and 
philosophy, to deal with relevance - an elusive, human notion.. The concern 
with relevance, as a key notion in information science, is traced to the 
problems of scientific communication.. Relevance is considered as a measure of 
the effectiveness of a contact between a source and a destination in a 
communication process.. The different views of relevance that emerged are
interpreted and related within a framework of communication of knowledge..
Different views arose because relevance was considered at a number of different 
points in the process of knowledge communication.. It is suggested that there 
exists an interlocking, interplaying cycle of various systems of relevances..
