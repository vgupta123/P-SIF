on the close relationship between turbulent plane-couette
and pressure flows .
  author studies the velocity profiles measured by others in plane
and turbulent couette flow, such as is induced in parallel
channels of which one of the walls moves in its own plane .  he finds
these profiles to be satisfactorily describable in terms of the
seventh-power law, which was originally set up for plane and
turbulent pressure flow in channels where both walls are stationary .
further, he finds the shear law for pressure flow,
to be applicable also to the couette flow, in a similar range of
reynolds number, r .  no attempt is made in this concise
contribution to put these findings on a firmer basis through a theoretical
explanation .
