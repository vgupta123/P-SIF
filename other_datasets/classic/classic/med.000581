growth hormone
growth hormone influences protein, fat,
carbohydrate, and mineral metabolism.  it
promotes nitrogen retention, growth of
cartilage, transportation of amino acids
through the cell wall, and incorporation of
amino acids into protein.  this factor mo-
bilizes free fatty acids from adipose tissue
and increases the serum concentration of
these substances; long-term administration
of this hormone is followed by depletion of
body fat stores and inhibition of fatty acid
synthesis.  in diabetic subjects growth hor-
mone administration is followed by hyper-
glycemia, glycosuria, and ketosis; its effect
on carbohydrate metabolism in normal sub-
jects is more subtle.  sodium, potassium, and
inorganic phosphate are retained following
the administration of growth hormone.
hypercalciuria also accompanies such treat-
ment, an effect mediated through the para-
thyroid glands.
human growth hormone may be detected
in the serum through the use of the radio-
immunoassay.  the hypothalamus is inti-
mately involved with the control of the
secretion and release of growth hormone
from the pituitary.  there is a correlation
between the availability of glucose for me-
tabolism and the plasma concentration of
growth hormone; when glucose is unavail-
able growth hormone is released in order to
provide a substitute source of energy, fatty
acids.
the administration of growth hormone
to the patient with hypopituitarism is fol-
lowed by growth in many instances, but it
has not usually been effective in promoting
growth in individuals with other abnormali-
ties.  acquired resistance to the effect of
growth hormone is accompanied by the de-
velopment of antibodies directed against
this protein.
