the contraction of satellite orbits under the influence of air drag .
part iii . high eccentricity orbits . /0.2 e 1/ .
the effect of air drag on satellite orbits of eccentricity e less than
between 0.2 and 1 is presented . equations are derived which show how
perigee distance and orbital period vary with eccentricity during the
satellite's life, and how eccentricity is related to time,.and formulae
are obtained for the lifetime and the air density at perigee, in terms
of the rate of change of period . the results are also presented
graphically and their implications and limitations are discussed .
