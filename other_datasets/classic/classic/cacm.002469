Petri Nets and Speed Independent design
Petri nets are investigated as one method of
modeling speed independent asynchronous circuits. 
 A study of circuit realizations of Petri nets leads
to a demonstration of their usefulness in modeling 
speed independent operation.  This usefulness is emphasized
by the design of a speed independent processor 
from modules developed in the investigation of Petri net implementation.
