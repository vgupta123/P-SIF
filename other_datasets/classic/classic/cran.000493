real-gas laminar boundary layer skin friction and heat
transfer .
  the laminar-boundary-layer equations have been integrated
for the case of a flat plate over a wide range of free-stream
enthalpies and velocities and over a wide range of enthalpies of
the gas at the wall .  the range of free-stream velocities extended
up to 25,000 ft sec at low free-stream enthalpies, corresponding
to local conditions on a slender body traveling at high speeds .
at low free-stream velocities, the range of free-stream enthalpies
extended up to 400,000 btu slug, corresponding to the local
conditions on a blunt body traveling at speeds up to 25,000 ft sec .
the gas was assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at each
point in the boundary layer and diffusion effects were neglected .
the solutions to the boundary-layer equations were carried out
on a high-speed digital computing machine, both skin-friction and
heat-transfer coefficients being obtained from the computations .
  before presenting the results, the t' method of rubesin and
johnson for computing skin-friction coefficients for the
perfect-gas case is reviewed .  for the real-gas case, the average
temperature, t', is replaced by the average enthalpy, h', and the h'
method is then used to compute skin-friction coefficients .  these
values are in excellent agreement with the computing-machine
results .  it was found that the recovery factor for the real-gas
case can be approximated by, the best results for the
cases considered being obtained if a value of pr corresponding to
the enthalpy, h', is used .  using this recovery factor and
reynolds analogy, heat-transfer rates can be computed which,
with a few exceptions, are within 5 percent of values obtained
from computing-machine results .
