theory for supersonic two-dimensional, laminar, base-type
flows using the crocco-lees mixing concepts .
  a separated flow field, in which the incoming boundary layer
is undisturbed up to the separation point, is defined as a /
base-type/ flow .  examples are the flows over a blunt base and over
a backward-facing step .  the crocco-lees theory is applied to
the supersonic, two-dimensional, laminar, base-type flows
defined above .  the separated flow is divided into a mixing region
and a recompression (or reattachment) region .  calculations of
base pressure show its dependence on the mach number and on
two reynolds-number-dependent variables, and .
  it is shown that existing base-pressure data can be explained
by these results .
