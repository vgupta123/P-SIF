Current Awareness Searches on CT, CBAS and ASCA
  During the past year we have been one of the organizations
participating in the Chemical Society's experiment on the use
of routine computer searches of Chemical Titles (CT) and Chemical-
Biological Activities (CBAC) for current awareness.  For some
time we have also been subscribing to the Automatic Subject Citation
Alert (ASCA), which is produced by the Institute for Scientific
Information as a by-product of the Science Citation Index.  These
three sources differ in their scope and methods, but share the
same ultimate objective of providing a computer-based current
awareness service.
  CT covers journals in all branches of chemistry, but provides only
authors and titles, the latter translated into American and edited by 
breaking down complex words so that word fragments can be retrieved.
CBAC covers only papers on the interaction of chemical compounds with
biological systems, but provides abstracts which are available for
computer search.  The computer can also search for molecular
formulae and for Chemical Abstracts registry numbers of all
compounds included in the abstracts.  ASCA in its original form
was based on citations: the search profile can consist of a list of
references to older work, and the output is then a list of new papers
citing this work.  Last spring ASCA introduced a 'term search', which
is a search for words in the titles of current papers and is therefore
analogous to a CT search.
  This paper discusses and compares the results we have obtained so
far with these three services, and the potential use of systems of
this type.
