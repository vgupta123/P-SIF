Computers and Society: A Proposed Course for Computer Scientists
The purpose of this paper is to describe a course
concerned with both the effects of computers 
on society and the responsibilities of computer scientists
to society.  The impact of computers is divided 
into five components: political, economic, cultural, social,
and moral; the main part of the paper defines 
each component and presents examples of the relevant
issues.  In the remaining portions the possible 
formats for such a course are discussed, a topic by topic
outline is given, and a selected set of references 
is listed.  It is hoped that the proposal will make
it easier to initiate courses on this subject.
