Top Priority for Cataloging-In-Source
  After a century of public library service and progress, public
libraries attract less than a third, perhaps only a quarter of the adult
population, either to read and borrow books, or to look up information.  
But nearly 60 per cent of the population is over 21. Currently a few large city
libraries show slight decreases in  annual circulation, the major measure
of their usefulness.  Yet, nationally, circulation and the informational use 
of public libraries have in general steadily increased, especially in the last 
decade.  Possibly  because the number of public, college, university, and 
special libraries doubled, from 13,676 reported in 1960, to 27,746 in 1968 
(Publishers' Weekly, January 20, 1969).  And there are more than that many 
school libraries.
