Statistical Bibliography or Bibliometrics?
  The term statistical bibliography seems to have been first used by E.
Wyndham Hulme in 1922 when he delivered two lectures as the Sandars Reader
in bibliography at the University of Cambridge.  Subsequently the lectures
were published as a book.  Although the debt has never been explicitly
recognized by means of citations, Hulme anticipated modern work on the
history of science.  He used the term to mean the illumination of the
processes of science and technology by means of counting documents.  Hulme
both summarized the results of Cole and Eales and produced original work
on the growth of UK patents (relating these to social progress in the
UK) and on the changes displayed in the International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature (relating changes in subject and country production
of literature to international developments).
