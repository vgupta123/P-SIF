A New Method for Determining Linear Precedence
Functions for Precedence Grammars
The precedence relations of a precedence grammar can
be precisely described by a two-dimensional 
precedence matrix.  Often the information in the matrix
can be represented more concisely by a pair of 
vectors, called linear precedence functions.  A new algorithm
is presented for obtaining the linear precedence
functions when given the precedence matrix; this algorithm
is shown to possess several computational 
advantages.
