further comments on the inversion of large structural matrices .
in a recent note, klein referred to a paper co-authored by the writer,
and to ref. 3 .  regarding the subject of inversion of large-order
matrices, klein stated that he would show 'that the situation is not as
hopeless as the anove-mentioned authors intimate' .
the purpose of this note is not to take exception to klein/s
conclusions, but rather to disagree with his implication that the
authors of ref. 2 were pessimistic with respect to large-matrix
inversions .  two general methods of analysis were treated..  the
method of consistent distortion and the method of transfer matrices .
the first method leads directly to a relatively large matrix of
structural coefficients of both internal forces and displacements .
this matrix must be inverted to solve the problem .  the second method
ultimately produces a relatively small matrix requiring inversion.,
however, to arrive at this point one must perform a number of matrix
multiplications .
