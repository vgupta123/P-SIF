Quasilinearization and the Estimation
of Differential Operators from Eigenvalues
Given a linear ordinary differential operator
containing several unknown constants and a number 
of its eigenvalues, the values of the unknown constants
are estimated.  A precise formulation is provided, 
and an effective numerical procedure for solution is indicated.
  The results of some computational experiments 
are given.
