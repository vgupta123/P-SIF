on the kernel function of the integral equation relating the lift and
downwash distributions of oscillating finite wings in subsonic flow .
this report treats the kernel function of an integral equation that
relates a known or prescribed downwash distribution to an unknown lift
distribution for a harmonically oscillating finite wing in compressible
subsonic flow . the kernel function is reduced to a form that can be
accurately evaluated by separating the kernel function into two parts ..
 a part in which the singularities are isolated and analytically
expressed and a nonsingular part which may be tabulated . the form of the
kernel function for the sonic case /mach number of 1/ is treated
separately . in addition, results for the special cases of mach number
of o /incompressible case/ and frequency of o /steady case/ are given .
the derivation of the integral equation which involves this kernel
function, originally performed elsewhere /see, for example, naca
technical memorandum 979/, is reproduced as an appendix . another appendix
gives the reduction of the form of the kernel function obtained herein
for the three-dimensional case to a known result of possio for
two-dimensional flow . a third appendix contains some remarks on the
evaluation of the kernel function, and a fourth appendix presents an
alternate form of expression for the kernel function .
