non-linear analysis of heated, cambered wings by the matrix force
method .
various extensions of the matrix force method for complex structure
analysis are presented and illustrated with the objective of expanding
its range to handle the problems likely to be encountered in advanced
vehicle wing design .  methods are covered in detail for (1) determining
the change in flexibility that occurs when thermal stresses are present,
and also how large these stresses must be to cause buckling, (2)
including the non-linear effect of large deflections by an iterative
procedure, and (3) analyzing a wing that is initially slightly cambered
and warped with either or both of the aforementioned effects present .
formulas are given for calculating the input matrix terms as are the
matrix equations and supporting theoretical discussion .  an example
illustrates the nature and magnitude of the effects being examined .
