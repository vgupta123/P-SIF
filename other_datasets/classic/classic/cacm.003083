Pseudochaining in Hash Tables
This paper presents pseudochaining as a new
collision-resolution method.  Pseudochaining is 
half way between open addressing and chaining.  It owes
its name to the fact that link fields are present 
in each cell of the hash table which permits "chaining"
of the first overflow items in the table.  The 
efficiency of the method is derived and a tradeoff analysis is given.
