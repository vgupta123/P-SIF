A Probabilistic Search Strategy for MEDLARS
   One technique for searching a Co-ordinate Index is to compare each reference
with a Boolean expression of index terms.. This divides the file into retrieved
and not-retrieved references.. An alternative is to assign each reference score
calculated from its index terms and to retrieve the N highest scoring 
references in the file.. This scoring technique has several advantages in
theory, and it performed slightly better in a retrieval test with N equal to
the number of references retrieved by the corresponding Boolean search.. In the
test a minimum value of N = 10 was used, and when less then this number of
references matched the Boolean search requirement, the Scoring technique
successfully widened the score of the search and retrieved twice as many 
relevant references as the Boolean searches..
