An Approach to Developing Computer Catalogs
   A method of developing computer catalogs is proposed which does not require
unit card conversion but rather the accumulation of data from operating 
programs..  It is proposed that the bibliographic and finding functions of the
catalog be separated, with the latter being the first automated.. Such 
automation is seen as being advantageous on a cost basis..
