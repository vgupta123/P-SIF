stability of the cylindrical shell of variable curvature .
the report is a first attempt to devise a calculation method
for representing the buckling behavior of cylindrical shells
of variable curvature .  the problem occurs, for instance, in
dimensioning wing noses, the stability behavior of which is
decisively influenced by the variability of curvature .  the
calculation is made possible by simplifying the stability
equations (permissible for the shell of small curvature) and
by assuming that the curvature as a function of the arc
length s can be represented by a very few fourier terms .
we evaluated the formulas for the special case of an
ellipse-like half oval with an axis ratio under
compression in longitudinal direction, shear, and a combination of
shear and compression .  however, the results can also be
applied approximately to an unsymmetrical oval-shell segment
under compression, shear, and bending so that the numerical
values contained in the diagrams 10 to 12 represent directly
dimensioning data for the wing nose .
