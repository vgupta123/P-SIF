Information Retrieval and Processing
    The present book embodies a change in structure and focus to reflect
the fact that the reader of today's book is much more likely to be an
interested college student with a great awareness of the current information
revolution than was the case ten years ago.  Thus, hardware, materials, and
processes used in connection with information systems are discussed first,
in Chapters Two through Four.  The subject of information retrieval per se
begins with Chapters Five and Six, which have to do with librarianship 
and documentation.  Because of their somewhat historical slant, these
chapters (along with Seven) are the only ones taken from the 1963 book
which adhere to their original character.  Chapter Seven presents a simplified
concept of an information system and its components, and paves the way for
discussion of computerized retrieval in the chapters to follow, especially
for data retrieval in Chapter Eight and document retrieval in Chapter Nine.
Chapters Ten through Twelve, on language processing, evaluation, and user
studies, describe important facets of the information retrieval field that have
developed strongly since 1963.
