Measurements of Segment Size
Distributions of segment sizes measured under routine operating con
ditions on a computer system which utilizes variable sized segments
(the Burroughs B5500) are discussed.  The most striking feature
of the measurements is the large number of small segments-about 60
percent of the segments in use contain less than 40 words.  Although
the results are certainly not installation independent, and although they 
are particularly influenced by features of the B5500 ALGOL system, they 
should be relevant to the design of new computer systems,
especially with respect to the organization of paging schemes.
