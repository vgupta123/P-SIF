On the Role of Subjectivity in Establishing, Using, Operating and Evaluating
Information Retrieval Systems
Treatise II on Retrieval System Theory
   The personal literature search of a scientist is strongly governed by
subjective influences.. If he delegates his literature search he should always 
be aware of the problems necessarily emanating from his subjective view.. This
prevents him from imposing unsatisfiable demands on the delegated search,
particularly with respect to its expected performance, and makes him conscious
of the fact that in order to satisfy his entire information need he cannot 
dispense with the browsing serendipity of his personal literature search.. He
will also better understand the peculiarities of the documentary methods needed
for operating large and continuously growing systems as compared with the 
methods sufficient for his personal file..
   The information scientist on the other hand, in charge of establishing, 
operating, and evaluating retrieval systems of high performance and survival 
power, should take into consideration the pronouncedly subjective character of
fundamental notions such as "information" and "order".. This gives him a better
understanding of the kind of inquiries submitted to him and of the inherently,
even if latently, subjective character of several fundamental operations in 
storage and retrieval and will cause him to refrain from futile attempts to 
make such operations more "objective" and formal.. Such a better mutual
understanding will be bound to promote advance in methodology and psychology of 
scientific communication..
