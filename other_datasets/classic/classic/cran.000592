design of axial compressors .
design of axial compressors .
the main types of axial compressors are described, and the use of
generalized design curves to make performance estimates is advocated . the
different variables are weight, power, pressure ratio, temperature rise,
 mass flow, rotational speed, stage efficiency, blade bending stresses
due to aerodynamic loading, and methods and materials of construction .
air outlets, flow coefficients and different blade forms are also
considered .
