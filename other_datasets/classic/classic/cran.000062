similar solutions for the compressible laminar boundary
layer with heat transfer and pressure gradient .
  stewartson's transformation is applied to the laminar compressible
boundary-layer equations and the
requirement of similarity is introduced,
resulting in a set of ordinary nonlinear differential equations
previously quoted by stewartson, but unsolved .  the requirements of the
system are ..  prandtl number of 1.0, linear viscosity-temperature
relation across the boundary layer, an
isothermal surface, and the particular
distributions of free-stream velocity
consistent with similar solutions .
this system admits axial pressure
gradients of arbitrary magnitude, heat
flux normal to the surface, and arbitrary mach numbers .
  the system of differential equations is transformed to an integral
system, with the velocity ratio as
the independent variable .  for this
system, solutions are found for pressure gradients varying from that
causing separation to the infinitely favorable gradient and for wall
temperatures from absolute zero to twice the free-stream stagnation
temperature .  some solutions for separated flows are also presented .
  for favorable pressure gradients, the solutions are unique .  for
adverse pressure gradients, where the solutions are not unique, two
solutions of the infinite family of possible solutions are identified as
essentially viscid at the outer edge of the boundary layer and the
remainder essentially inviscid .  for
the case of favorable pressure gradients
with heated walls, the velocity within
a portion of the boundary layer is
shown to exceed the local external velocity .
the variation of a reynolds
analogy parameter, which indicates the ratio of skin friction to heat
transfer, is from zero to 7.4 for a surface of temperature twice the
free-stream stagnation temperature, and from zero to 2.8 for a surface
held at absolute zero where the value 2 applies to a flat plate .
