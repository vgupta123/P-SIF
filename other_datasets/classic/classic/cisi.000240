Books for Junior College Libraries
  The primary purpose of this publication is to serve as a
book selection guide for junior and community college
libraries, whether long established, newly established, or
in the planning and preinstruction stage.  The need for a
new and authoritative book list has long been expressed
by administrators, faculty members, and librarians.  It is
hoped that the present list will meet this need, and that
it will also be useful in four-year colleges, with special
reference to their lower-division work; in secondary
schools, especially where accelerated and honors programs
or courses for advanced college placement are offered;
and in public libraries seeking to satisfy the demands of
high school and college students.
