GEORGE 3-A General Purpose Time Sharing and Operating System
An Operating System is described which will
run on a wide variety of configurations of the 
I.C.T. 1900, and can handle a large number of online console
users while at the same time running several 
off line (background) jobs.  The system is not oriented
towards either mode and can be either a batch 
processing system (such as the ATLAS Supervisor, IBSYS,
or GECOS), or a multiaccess system (resembling, 
to the user, CTSS or MULTICS), or both simultaneously,
depending on the installation, which can adjust 
the Schedulers.  Both online users and off line jobs use
a common Command Language.  The system includes 
a Multilevel device-independent File Store.
