a rapid approximate method for the design of hub shroud profiles of
centrifugal impellers of given blade shape .
a rapid approximate method for the design of centrifugal compressors of
given blade shape with compressible nonviscous flow characteristics has
been developed using techniques based upon stream-filament theory .
axial symmetry is assumed, but meridional-plane forces derived from
tangential pressure gradients are included .
the method was applied to the design of an impeller in order to
determine the approximate maximum meridional streamline spacing that
could be used . three numerical solutions for different streamline
spacings were made using the same hub profile, blade shape, and
prescribed velocity distribution along the hub . the shroud profiles
obtained from the three solutions, which utilized 3, 5, and 9
stream-tubes, were negligibly different . the approximate computing time
required was 15 hours per streamtube .
