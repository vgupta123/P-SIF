Keyword-In-Context Index for Technical Literature (KWIC Index)
   A distinction is made between bibliographical indexes for new and past
literature based on the willingness of the user to trade perfection for 
currency.. Indexes giving keywords in their context are proposed as suitable 
for disseminating new information.. These can be entirely machine-generated 
and hence kept up-to-date with the current literature.. A compatible coding 
scheme to identify the indexed documents is also proposed.. In it elements are
automatically extracted from the usual identifiers of the document so that the 
coded identifier yields a maximum of information while remaining susceptible 
to normal methods of ordering..
