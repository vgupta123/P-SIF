Optimum Data Base Reorganization Points
In certain data base organization schemes the
cost per access may increase due to structural 
inefficiencies caused by updates.  By reorganizing
the data base the cost per access may be reduced. 
 However, the high cost of a reorganization prohibits
frequent reorganizations.  This paper examines 
strategies for selecting the optimum reorganization points.
