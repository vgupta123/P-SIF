an experimental study of jet-flap compressor blades .
the results of a preliminary experimental investigation to determine the
 feasibility of using the jet flap to improve the section
characteristics of an axial-flow compressor blade are presented and discussed
 trailing edge . internal design of the blade is described and details
of the resulting jet flow are given . also included are wind-tunnel
design and test procedures for the two-dimensional cascade used in the
test .
test results are presented in the form of the measured turning angle,
pressure rise, and lift coefficient . they are examined with particular
reference to the prevention of rotating stall .
