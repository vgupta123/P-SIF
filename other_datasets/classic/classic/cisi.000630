A Novel Philosophy for the Design of Information Storage
and Retrieval Systems Appropriate for the '70's
   The philosophy of a systems approach to the design of information
storage and retrieval systems is suggested in which the computer is
recognized in its proper perspective as a powerful and effective
alternative tool.. This philosophy is in contrast to a prevalent
philosophy of the '60's in which many information systems designers
touted the computer as the answer to all information storage and
retrieval situations.. Important principles of information system
design incorporated within the framework of the novel philosophy
for the '70's are presented.. These are:  the performance of users'
needs studies by the representative small group technique; the
analysis of users' needs including their rank ordering by priority; 
the selection and adaptation for a specific application of a suitable
existent information storage and retrieval system from those available; 
the involvement of potential users in the system design by establishing
a model with which they can interact and provide feedback; and the final
design of a cost-effective system.. A number of pitfalls arising from
earlier design methodologies are pointed out, and the avoidance of these
pitfalls by adopting a true systems approach is discussed..
