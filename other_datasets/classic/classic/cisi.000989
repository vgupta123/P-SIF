An Analysis of the Universal Decimal Classification as a Term System for 
Nuclear Science and Technology
   Explores the possibilities of merging the terminology of the Universal
Decimal Classification System with that of a term system - Engineers Point
Council's Thesaurus - for nuclear science and technology.. Concludes, from the
evidence presented, that UDC can be effectively used as a term system.. Proposes
that the two systems coordinate the terms and merge a major thesaurus (EJC) with
an effective classification scheme of international scope (UDC) to provide a
needed tool in the area of classification and documentation..
