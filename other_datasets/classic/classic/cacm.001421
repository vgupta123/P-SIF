A Contribution to the Development of ALGOL
A programming language similar in many respects
to ALGOL 60, but incorporating a large number 
of improvements based on six years experience with that
language, is described in detail.  Part I consists 
of an introduction to the new language and a summary
of the changes made to ALGOL 60, together with a 
discussion of the motives behind there visions.  Part II
is a rigorous definition of the proposed language. 
 Part III describes a set of proposed standard procedures
to be used with the language, including facilities 
for input/output.
