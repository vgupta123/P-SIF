the speech production and spoken language of the deaf
the distinction was made between speech production and spoken language in
analysing the oral output of those with hearing impairment.  a brief review of
studies in both areas was undertaken, including the report of a new electronic
visual monitoring device, the glossal transducer.  it was postulated that the
deaf utilise a unique visual-to-motor conversion within the brain when speaking
and monitor conscously by tactile-kinaesthetic control.  the more recent
studies relate to the syntactical features of the speech of the deaf.  these
show that deafness creates telegraphic speech with reduced sentence length and
omissions of essential words such as functors.  the speech of the deaf seems to
contain mostly nouns and verbs, with a limited number of words used to expand
verb forms.
