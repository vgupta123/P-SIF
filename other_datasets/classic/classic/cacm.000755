An Exponential Method of Numerical Integration
of Ordinary Differential Equations
A formula for numerical integration is prepared,
which involves an exponential term.  This 
formula is compared to two standard integration methods,
and it is shown that for a large class of differential 
equations, the exponential formula has superior stability
properties for large step sizes.  Thus this 
formula may be used with a large step size to decrease the
total computing time for a solution significantly, 
particularly in those engineering problems where high accuracy is not needed.
