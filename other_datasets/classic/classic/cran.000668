measurements of stagnation point heat transfer at low
reynolds number .
  measurements of stagnation point heat transfer are presented
in the reynolds number range between the free molecular flow
and the range where modified boundary layer theory still applies .
the measurements are compared with the analytical methods
set forth by ferri, zakkay, and ting .  the results show smooth
transition between the two regions and indicate that the
predicted reynolds number for which the modified boundary layer
theory can be used is in agreement with experiments .  in the
lower range of reynolds number the ratio of
decreases and reaches a value of 1 at a reynolds number of 40 .
