lower buckling load in the non-linear buckling theory
of thin shells .
  for thin shells the relation between
the load p and the deflection beyond the
classical buckling load is very often
non-linear .  for instance, when a uniform thin
circular cylinder is loaded in the axial
direction, the load p when plotted against the
end-shortening has the characteristic
shown in fig. 1 .  if the strain energy s and the
total potential are calculated,
their behavior can be represented by the
curves shown in figs. 2 and 3 .  it can be
demonstrated that the branches oc and ab
corresponds to stable equilibrium configurations
and the branch bc to unstable
equilibrium configurations .  the point b is then
the point of transition from stable to
unstable equilibrium configurations .
