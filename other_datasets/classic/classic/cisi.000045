Measuring the Reliability of Subject Classification by Men and Machines
   Procedures for measuring the consistency of document classification are 
described.. Three subject specialists classified 997 abstracts of psychological 
reports into one of eleven categories.. These abstracts were also mechanically
classified by a computer program using a factor score computational procedure.. 
Each abstract was scored for all categories and assigned to the one with the
highest score.. The three manual classifications were compared with each other
and with the mechanical classifications, and a series of contingency 
coefficients was computed.. The average reliability of manual classification 
procedures was equal to .870.. The correlation between automatic and manual 
classification was .766..
