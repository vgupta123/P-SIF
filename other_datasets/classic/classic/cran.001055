non-linear bending and buckling of circular plates .
  iterative solutions of finite difference
approximations of the non-linear von karman
plate equations are presented .  results
are obtained for circular plates under a
variety of boundary conditions subjected to
either uniform lateral pressure or uniform
edge thrust .
  the solution, carried out numerically on
the aec univac at new york university,
yields a complete description of stresses
and deflections for an apparently unlimited
range of load parameters .  in addition, boundary
layer phenomena are discussed .  for
computing purposes, this iterative method proves
to be superior to the previously used
power series method and may be applicable to
other non-linear problems .
