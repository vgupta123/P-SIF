Building Library Collections
  Each year thousands of books are published by the
general, the technical, the governmental and the university
presses in this and other countries.  From this overwhelming
mass of new publications every library must, within the limit
of its funds, select that small part which will be most 
beneficial to the community it serves.  This is properly an
awesome responsibility to the young inexperienced librarian.  To
the competent veteran it is a task which though carried on
week after week never can approach the ease of a well
mastered routine.  Each book examined requires the exercise
of careful judgement, integrity, emotional control at times,
and scrupulous honesty, guided always by a sense of purpose.
