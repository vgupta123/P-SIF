review of panel flutter and effects of aerodynamic noise
part i..  panel flutter .
with the development of high-speed aircraft and missiles, vibration
of panels has become a problem of practical significance .  many
of the failures of the early german rockets after attaining supersonic
speed have been attributed to the development of such panel
oscillations .  it appears this
phenomenon is not of much concern in the subsonic
speed range., however, in the supersonic speed range panels may develop
oscillations which cause instability of the structure .  this effect has
been exhibited experimentally under controlled laboratory conditions
motion is limited and buckling may not be a serious design problem .
in these cases panel flutter is still of importance because of its
effect on the fatigue life and the allowable stresses for design of
the panel material .
the oscillations of panels may be due either to aerodynamic force
induced by the motion of the panel, or to aerodynamic noise, or
buffeting (irregular motion induced by turbulence in the flow) .
the interaction between aerodynamic forces and panel motions, usually
referred to as /panel flutter,/ has been investigated by several workers
in recent years .  since the problem is too complex to be dealt with
in its entirety, simplifying assumptions have been made in these
investigations .  the literature is marked by a certain degree of
controversy over the validity of these assumptions and the applicability of
the results obtained .  a brief review of the literature with reference
to several of the approximations made and the results obtained follows .
