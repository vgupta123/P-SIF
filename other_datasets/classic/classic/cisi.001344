Some Correlates of a Citation Measure of Productivity in Science
   The Science Citation Index provides an easy way to derive criterion
measures of scientific accomplishment.. Measures derived from citation counts,
the principal criterion, have high face validity.. These criterion measures are
found to have a low but positive correlation with the quality of scientists'
graduate education and no relation to his measured IQ score. Plans for 
future research on the correlates of scientific productivity are briefly
discussed..
