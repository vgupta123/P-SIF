The Growth, Utility, and Obsolescence of Scientific Periodical Literature
   Line's recently proposed technique for correcting the 'apparent' half-life
to allow for the rate of growth of the literature and Vickery's critical 
analysis of the proposal are both further analyzed.. Using the concept of 
utility and considering the sampling variances involved, the paper shows that
Line's technique is both questionable and impractical, and that a further 
factor - the growth of the number of contributors - needs to be allowed for in
Vickery's analysis.. A collaborative empirical investigation is proposed..
