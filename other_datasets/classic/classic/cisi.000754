A Test for the Separation of Relevant and Non-Relevant Documents 
in Experimental Retrieval Collections
   Many retrieval experiments are intended to discover ways of improving 
performance, taking the results obtained with some particular technique as a 
baseline.. The fact that substantial alterations to a system often have little 
or no effect on particular collections is puzzling.. This may be due to the 
initially poor separation of relevant and non-relevant documents.. The paper 
presents a procedure for characterizing this separation for the collection, 
which can be used to show whether proposed modifications of the base system are 
likely to be useful..
