2281. inhibition of active transport of sugars through rat intestine in vitro.
ii. action of mepacrine, atractyloside and selenite
it is shown that mepacrine, atractyloside and selenite, which had been regarded
as inhibitors of intestinal absorption of glucose, are inhibitors of active
transport of sugars in sacs of everted jejunum of rat (wilson and wiseman's
method).  mepacrine 5 x 10 -3 m and 10 -2 m inhibit, by 85% and 100%
respectively, the active transport of galactose.  with atractyloside 10 -5 m
and 10 -3 m, the inhibitions were 77% and 100% and, with selenite 10 -4 m and
10 -3 m, about 70%.  in general the inhibitors are effective within orders of
magnitude which are similar in vivo and in vitro.  atractyloside is rather more
effective in vitro than in vivo, and mepacrine rather less.  it is easier to
achieve total inhibitions of the active transport of sugars in vitro than of
intestinal absorption from isotonic solutions in vivo.
