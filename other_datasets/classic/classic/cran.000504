stability of compressible boundary layers induced by
a moving wave .
  the problem of determining the stability of compressible
viscous flows with nonzero surface velocities is formulated and is
shown to be identical to that for conventional boundary layers,
with only a redefinition of the mach and reynolds numbers
required .  specific consideration is given to the wall boundary
layer behind a moving shock wave, and the minimum critical
reynolds numbers are obtained for various shock velocities .
the entire stability map is determined for the limiting case of a
weak wave, which is analogous to the rayleigh problem .
  the minimum critical reynolds number is found to increase
monotonically with shock velocity--i.e., with increasing surface
cooling and stream mach number combined .  for the ratio of
wall to stream velocity of 2.92 with (shock mach number
of 2.18) the flow is found to be infinitely stable to two-dimensional
disturbances .
  experimental transition data do not follow the trends predicted
by the theory .  in fact, the transition reynolds numbers are
orders of magnitude below the computed minimum critical
reynolds numbers .  the lack of correlation between theory and
experiment is attributed to disturbances which are external to
the boundary layer .
