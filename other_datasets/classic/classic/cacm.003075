Fast Parallel Sorting Algorithms
A parallel bucket-sort algorithm is presented
that requires time O(log n) and the use of n 
processors.  The algorithm makes use of a technique that
requires more space than the product of processors 
and time.  A realistic model is used model is used in which
no memory contention is permitted.  A procedure 
is also presented to sort n numbers in time O(k log
n) using n 1 + 1/k processors, for k an arbitrary 
integer.  The model of computation for this procedure
permits simultaneous fetches from the same memory 
location.
