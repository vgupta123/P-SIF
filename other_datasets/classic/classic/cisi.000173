Authoritarian Personality
  This is a book about social discrimination.  But its purpose is not
simply to add a few more empirical findings to an already extensive body
of information.  The central theme of the work is a relatively new
concept - the rise of an "anthropological" species we call the
authoritarian type of man.  In contrast to the bigot of the older style
he seems to combine the ideas and skills which are typical of a highly 
industrialized society with irrational or anti-rational 
beliefs.  He is at the same time enlightened and superstitious, proud
to be an individualist and in constant fear of not being like all the others,
jealous of his independence and inclined to submit blindly to power
and authority.  The character structure which comprises these conflicting
trends has already attracted the attention of modern philosophers and
political thinkers.  This book approaches the problem with the means of
socio-psychological research.
