Formal Languages and Their Relation to Automata
  This book presents the theory of formal languages as a coherent theory
and makes explicit its relationship to automata.  The book begins with an
explanation of the notion of a finite description of a language.  The
fundamental descriptive device - the grammar - is explained, as well as
its three major subclasses - regular, context-free, and context-sensitive
grammars.  The context-free grammars are treated in detail, and such topics
as normal forms, derivation trees, and ambiguity are covered.  Four types of
automata equivalent to the four types of grammars are described.  These
automata are the finite automaton, the pushdown automaton, the linear
bounded automaton, and the Turing machine.  The Turing machine is covered in
detail, and unsolvability of the halting problem shown.  The book concludes
with certain advanced topics in language theory - closure properties,
computational complexity, deterministic pushdown automata, LR(k) grammars,
stack automata, and decidability.
