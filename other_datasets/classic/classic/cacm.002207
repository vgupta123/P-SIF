The Automatic Integration of Ordinary Differential Equations
An integration technique for the automatic
solution of an initial value problem for a set of 
ordinary differential equations is described.  A criterion
for the selection of the order of approximation 
is proposed.  The objective of the criterion is to increase
the step size so as to reduce solution time. 
An option permits the solution of "stiff" differential
equations.  A program embodying the techniques 
discussed appears in Algorithm 407.
