low speed wind tunnel tests on a two dimensional aerofoil
with split flap near the ground .
  pressure distributions have been
measured on a 10 thick two-dimensional
aerofoil of r.a.e.101 section fitted with
split flaps deflected at 15 and 55 .
measurements were made at two distances
above a ground plate, and also without
the ground plate .  the results have been
integrated to give the sectional
lift, drag and pitching-moment coefficients .
