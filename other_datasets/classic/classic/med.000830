hip disarticulation in a
patient with hemophilia
disarticulation of the hip in a hemophiliac patient
was performed because of a severe osteomyelitis
involving the entire right femur and was lifesaving.
the following are suggestions for hemotologic man-
agement: (1) infected wounds in hemophiliac pa-
tients should be left open initially.  (2) electro-
cautery should not be used in an infected wound of
a hemophiliac patient.  (3) a safe fibrinogen prepa-
ration potent in the antihemophilic factor is now
available in this country and is a highly significant
advance in the surgical treatment of hemophilia.
