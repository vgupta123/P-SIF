method for calculation of compressible laminar boundary
layer characteristics in axial pressure gradient with
zero heat transfer .
  the karman-pohlhausen method is extended primarily to sixth-degree
velocity profiles for determining
the characteristics of the compressible
laminar boundary layer over an adiabatic
wall in the presence of an axial
pressure gradient .  it is assumed that the prandtl number is unity and
that the coefficient of viscosity varies linearly with the temperature .
a general approximate solution which permits a rapid determination of
the boundary-layer characteristics for any given free-stream mach number
and given velocity distribution at the outer edge of the boundary layer
is obtained .  numerical examples indicate that this solution will in
practice lead to results of satisfactory
accuracy, including the critical
reynolds number for stability .  for the special purpose of calculating
the location of the separation point in an adverse pressure gradient, a
short and simple method, based on the use of a seventh-degree velocity
profile, is derived .  the numerical example given here indicates that
this method should in practice lead to sufficiently accurate results .
for the special case of flow near a forward stagnation point it is shown
that the karman-pohlhausen method with the usual fourth-degree profiles
leads to results of adequate accuracy, even for the critical reynolds
number .
