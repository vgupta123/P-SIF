viscous hypersonic similitude .
  an extension of classical hypersonic similitude is developed
which takes into account the interaction effect of the
displacement thickness of the boundary layer .  a basic result of this
viscous similitude is that the total drag including frictional drag
obeys the classical similarity law for the pressure drag .
additional similarity conditions governing viscous effects must be
imposed in this similitude .
  underlying the similitude is a new hypersonic boundary-layer
independence principle .  according to this principle, the
principal part of a hypersonic boundary layer with given pressure
and wall temperature distributions and free-stream total
enthalpy is independent of the (high) external mach number
distribution outside the boundary layer .
  various features of viscous hypersonic similitudes are
discussed .  it is found, for example, that it applies to three-
dimensional boundary-layer interaction effects on flat bodies, provided
the concepts of strip theory may be applied, and provided the
aspect ratio is an invariant .
