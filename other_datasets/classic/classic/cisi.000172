As We May Think
  As Director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development,
Dr. Vannevar Bush has coordinated the activities of some six
thousand leading American scientists in the application of
science to warfare.  In this significant article he holds up
an incentive for scientists when the fighting has ceased.  He
urges that men of science should then turn to the massive task
of making more accessible our bewildering store of knowledge.
For years inventions have extended man's physical powers rather than
the powers of his mind.  Trip hammers that multiply the fists,
microscopes that sharpen the eye, and engines of destruction and
detection are new results, but not the end results, of modern
science.  Now, says Dr.Bush, instruments are at hand which, if properly
developed, will give man access to and command over the inherited
knowledge of the ages.  The perfection of these pacific instruments
should be the first objective of our scientists as they emerge from
their war work.  Like Emerson's famous address of 1837 on "The
American Scholar," this paper by Dr. Bush calls for a new relationship
between thinking man and the sum of our knowledge. - The Editor
