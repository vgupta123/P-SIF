extrahepatic biliary atresia: comments on the
frequency of potentially operable cases
in a 10 year period, 35 infants with extrahepatic biliary atresia were
encountered.  twenty-eight babies, who were subjected to surgery and operative
liver biopsy, are discussed.  although an operable lesion was detected at
laparotomy in only one baby, 5 further potentially correctable lesions were
discovered in the 14 necropsies performed.  review of the literature revealed
that few authors have discussed necropsy findings and that confirmation of the
diagnosis by liver biopsy has been neglected in many cases, including some
of those claimed as surgical cures.  it is concluded that the frequency of
potentially operable forms of biliary atresia is not really known.
