Design and Operation of a Computer Search Center for Chemical Information
  The objective of the Computer Search Center (CSC) of the Information Sciences
section of IIT Research Institute (IITRI) is to provide a link between a wide
variety of users and the rapidly expanding information resources in machine-
readable form.  Because none of the available computer search programs met
the criteria of the center, and because of the need to handle a variety of data
bases, new general purpose computer programs were written, and a tape format
was developed so that a wide variety of data bases can be searched by the same
computer program.  The center was designed to provide current awareness and
retrospective search services from both document-type and data-type computerized
data files.  The desire to develop transferable programs for use at many
installations prompted the adoption of the machine-independent compiler 
language PL/1 and the use of IBM 360 series computers.  The objective of 
education and training led to the development of a "Search Manual" for profile
preparation, the development of a workbook in "Modern Techniques in Chemical
Information," the teaching of a new academic course, and the presentation of
seminars.
