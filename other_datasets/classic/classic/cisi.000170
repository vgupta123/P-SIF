An Assessment of Quality in Graduate Education
  Before this study was begun in the spring of 1964, serious deliberation
was given to the question of American Council of Education sponsorship of
an evaluation of selected graduate programs of major universities that
comprise an important segment of the Council's membership.  There was
never any question about the need for doing in a systematic and objective
way what necessarily goes on continually in any event, though usually
in a piecemeal and more impressionistic way.  Our Commission on Plans
and Objectives for Higher Education, and other leading educators consulted,
concluded that a thoroughgoing study should be made and that the Council's
aegis was a suitable one.
