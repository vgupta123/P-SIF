Interlibrary Requests
  Our survey, in other words, is offered within the bounds of descriptive
or deductive statistics which seeks to analyze a group, not attempt to estimate
the parameters of that population of which the group has been chosen as a
sample.  The latter role is assumed by inductive statistics which makes use
of probability sampling. Accordingly, our data are presented in those forms
and with those statistical measures appropriate to the methods of descriptive
statistics: arrays, frequency distributions, breakdowns by categories which
seem of optimum value to the librarian and administrator, e.g., the frequency
of requests for journals versus monographs, the age of journals requested,
the types and ages of materials requested by the various types of libraries
(university, pharmaceutical, etc.).  The tables are arranged to give evidence
of the types of frequency distribution revealed by the Survey, as well as to
indicate central tendency, dispersion, rank order, and possibly correlations
for significant factors.
