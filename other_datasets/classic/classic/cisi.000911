Libraries and the Organization of Knowledge
  From time to time, in the course of its historical development, a
professional activity enters a new stage.  This usually takes place as the
culmination of a series of modifications to the practice of the art, arising
out of changes in the social situation in which the profession operates.
Skilled workers, sensitive to changing needs, alter or refine their practice
so that it develops in tune with the progress of society itself.  Descriptive
accounts of new or improved methods appear in the literature; and, from
time to time, a leading thinker makes a new synthesis by combining these
explanations into a system, or theory, which gives a rational account
of what is going on, and so prepares the way forward.
  This is what Dean Jesse H. Shera has set out to do in this collection of
his essays and addresses.
