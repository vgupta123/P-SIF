effects on adjacent surfaces from the firing of rocket jets .
this paper is a preliminary and brief account of some research currently
 being conducted to determine the jet effects on adjacent surfaces from
the firing of rocket jets . measurements of jet-effect pressures on a
flat plate as well as shadowgraphs are presented that were obtained when
 a rocket jet at a mach number of 3 was exhausted downstream and
upstream into free-stream flow at a mach number of 2 located from 2 to 4.7
 rocket-jet-exit diameters from the plate . the jet effects on the flat
plate with the rocket jet exhausting downstream are of the same order of
 magnitude as those previously obtained from sonic exits with a total
pressure 10 times lower . a maximum pressure coefficient on the plate of
rocket-jet-exit diameters below the plate, and an integration of the
measured jet-effect pressures at this position resulted in a normal
force on the plate equal to 2.3 times the thrust output of the rocket
jet .
