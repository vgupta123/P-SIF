analysis of effects of diffusion of a foreign gas into
the laminar boundary layer of a supersonic flow of
air in a tube .
  adiabatic wall temperatures and recovery factors are calculated
for pipe flows with an entrance mach number of 5 and with uniform
injection of helium .  predicted values of the recovery factor
increase slowly with increasing injection rate and with increasing
distance from the tube entrance .
