simple shear flow past a flat plate in a compressible
viscous fluid .
  by transformation of variables, the problem of a simple shear flow of
a compressible fluid over a flat plate is reduced to the corresponding
problem for an incompressible fluid .  the prandtl number of the
compressible fluid is assumed to be unity and its viscosity to be a linear
function of temperature .
