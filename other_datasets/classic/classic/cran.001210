on slender airfoil theory for nonequilibrium flow .
  an exact linear theory for nonequilibrium flow past a thin
airfoil is given .  green's function technique is used to solve the
boundary value problem for the governing third order equation .
upon satisfying the boundary condition on the airfoil surface an
integral equation is obtained which has an exact solution .  the
final expression for the velocity potential, given as an integral over
the source strength times the green's function, shows that the
solution is dependent not only on the slope variation of the airfoil
but also on its curvature variation .  this turns out to be the case
for all free-stream mach numbers .
  as an example, the supersonic flow past a wedge is considered .
