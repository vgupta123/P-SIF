Evaluation of MEDLARS Documentation
  This report presents the results of a detailed analysis by
the National Library of Medicine of the performance of
MEDLARS (its Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval
System) in relation to 300 actual requests made to the
system in 1966 and 1967.  Thanks to this study, we now know
considerably more about the requirements of MEDLARS users,
how well the system is meeting these requirements, and what
we must do to improve the overall performance level.  The
investigation is timely:  the Library is now planning a
second-generation MEDLARS, and the design of MEDLARS II
should benefit greatly from our knowledge of factors affecting
the performance of the present system.
