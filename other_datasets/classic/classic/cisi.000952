Characteristics of the Research Literature Used by Chemists
and Physicists in the United States
  The increasing growth and complexities of research libraries are natural
consequences of the growth of knowledge and the increasing complexity of 
knowledge. Librarians have tried to amass more and
more knowledge in the form of books for the benefit of the diverse interests of
their clienteles.  Their success in this activity has been reflected in the
increasing difficulties of identifying satisfactorily what they have.  The 
processes of cataloging, classifying, and related technical routines have 
become increasingly complex and expensive.  The processes
are of such a nature that the cost for adding each new item to a large library
is, on the average, potentially if not actually, higher than that for its
predecessor.  The total proportion of the budgets of large research libraries
that is spent for the processing of material, as distinguished
from the costs of its purchase or its direct
servicing, is now such as to give librarians pause for fear a day may come when
nearly all the money available to large libraries will be spent in processing
material, and little will be left to service the collection or to buy new books!
