Application of Level Changing to a Multilevel Storage Organization
A technique for organizing the devices of a computer
storage system is described.  This technique, 
called the multilevel store, provides a means for economically
satisfying the requirements for very large 
storage capacities of certain data management and information
retrieval systems.  The concept of level 
changing is introduced and its application to the multilevel
store is discussed.  A possible means for 
physically organizing the information for efficient
use of the multilevel store is presented.
