A Study of Methods for Systematically Abbreviating English Words and Names
   This study investigated various techniques for systematically abbreviating 
English words and names.. Most of the attention was given to the techniques 
which could be mechanized with a digital device such as a general purpose 
digital computer.. Particular was paid to techniques that could process 
incoming  information without prior knowledge of its existence (i.e., no table
lookups).. Thirteen basic techniques and their modifications are described..
In addition, most of the techniques were tested on a sample of several thousand
subject words and several thousand proper names in order to provide a 
quantitative measure of comparison..
