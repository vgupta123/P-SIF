A Methodology for Test and Evaluation of Information Retrieval Systems
  A recognition of the importance of useful evaluative techniques is an 
indirect or secondary result of the hugely expanded national investment in 
scientific research.  Such recognition has followed the expenditure of much time
and money on the development of information systems which utilize advances in
information handling and data processing (primarily computer-oriented) to
handle the "explosion" of recorded information.  Information scientists from
a typically diverse group of parent disciplines are now cooperating not only
to develop methodologies of evaluation of such systems, but to apply them.
