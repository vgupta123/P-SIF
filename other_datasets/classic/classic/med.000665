the remaining kidney in irradiated
survivors of wilms's tumor
the intravenous urograms of 10 patients
who had survived 5 years after irradiation
for wilms's tumor were studied for kidney
size and configuration.  the diseased kidney
had been removed by nephrectomy.
the remaining kidneys had been sub-
jected to varying doses of ionizing radia-
tion at the time the area of the diseased
kidney was irradiated.  in none was there
evidence of atrophy.  all were within the
range of expected normal size and most of
them were enlarged.
