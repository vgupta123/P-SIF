supersonic axially symmetric nozzles .
  at each of twenty-one exit mach numbers, ranging
from 1.008 to 8.238, ten supersonic axially symmetric
nozzle shapes with plane sonic surfaces have been computed
on the eniac by the method of characteristics .  the
boundary of the shortest of each group of ten has a
sharp edge at the sonic plane, while the others have
smooth boundaries .  this report describes the computational
procedures and presents a sample of the results for twenty
nozzles .
  more extensive and elaborate tables of the results of the
entire computations are available at the ballistic
research laboratories .  nozzle contours can be obtained
accurately from them by interpolation for exit mach numbers
between 1.479 and 8.238 for a wide range of ratios of nozzle
length to throat diameter .
