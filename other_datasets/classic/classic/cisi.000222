Review of Criteria Used to Measure Library Effectiveness
   This article reports the results of survey of literature on measures of 
library effectiveness.. This survey led to the formulation of six criterion 
concepts  (accessibility, cost, user satisfaction, response time, cost/benefit
ratio and use).. The advantages and disadvantages of each method of 
measurement are discussed.. Several points which became clear during the 
analysis are discussed.. First, there is a relative lack of concern with the 
rationale behind the evaluation process, although the results invariably lead
to a confused interpretation when there is no clear understanding of the 
purpose of an evaluation.. Second, the total library system is rarely 
considered; instead, each evaluation criterion is taken in isolation rather
than as part of the whole.. Third, the library's preservation function has not
been considered at all..
