the theoretical wave drag of some bodies of revolution .
  this report investigates the wave drag of bodies
of revolution with pointed or open-nose forebodies
and pointed or truncated afterbodies .  the 'quasi-cylinder'
and 'slender-body' theories are reviewed, a reversibility
theorem is established, and the concept of the interference
effect of a forebody on an afterbody is introduced .
  the theories are applied to bodies whose profiles are either
straight or parabolic arcs, formulae and curves being
given for forebody and afterbody drag, and for the interference
drag .  the results of the two theories are compared
and are seen to agree well in the region of geometries where both
theories are applicable .
