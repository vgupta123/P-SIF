coombs-positive hemolytic anemia and generalized amyloidosis in
mice following transmission of subcellular leukemic material
following transmission with
cell-free supernatant fluid or with virus ex-
tract of leukemic tissue or plasma from vari-
ous types of murine plasma cell leukemias
a disease developed, characterized by hyper-
gammaglobulinemia, weight loss, anemia,
marked splenic, renal and hepatic amyloido-
sis and plasma cell infiltrations in the lungs.
the disease was also transmissible through
the placenta or with the milk of infected
mice.  in dba/2 males the incidence of the
disease was much higher (100%), the sur-
vival shorter and the anemia much more
severe than was the case in dba/2 females
and in (dba/2 x cba) f1 mice of both
sexes.  it is proposed that the development
of the lesions is mediated through an auto-
immune mechanism created by the antigenic
effect of the virus-transformed host cells.
