Library Automation:  Experience, Methodology, and Technology of the Library 
as an Information System
  The goal of this book, Library Automation: Experience, Methodology,
and Technology of the Library as an Information System, is to
provide a perspective of the library functions that have been or
might be mechanized or automated, an outline of the methodology
of the systems approach, an overview of the technology available to
the library, and a projection of the prospects for library automation.
  There is a concern in every library for the proper handling and
control of a veritable flood of material and for the prompt and
convenient fulfillment of service demands.  That concern is matched by
excitement about the possibilities for effective use of the computers
and communications network in many library functions.  Knowledge,
the library's stock-in-trade, is being generated at an unprecedented
rate and sought after with unprecedented intensity.  Technology, the
driving force behind the library's problems and one hope for future
solution, is being advanced to unprecedented levels.
