theoretical damping in roll and rolling moment due
to differential wing incidence for slender cruciform
wings and wing-body combinations .
  a method of analysis based on slender-wing theory is developed
to investigate the characteristics in roll of slender cruciform wings
and wing-body combinations .  the method makes use of the
conformal mapping processes of classical hydrodynamics which
transform the region outside a circle and the region outside
an arbitrary arrangement of line segments intersecting at the
origin .  the method of analysis may be utilized to solve other
slender cruciform wing-body problems involving arbitrarily
assigned boundary conditions .
  in the present report, the application of the method has
shown ..
differential incidence of both pairs of opposite surfaces of the
cruciform wing-body combinations are practically independent
of the body-diameter-maximum-span ratio up to a value of this
ratio of 0.3 .
arrangement is only 62 percent greater than that for a
corresponding planar wing-body combination .
dence of both pairs of the opposing surfaces of the cruciform
wing-body arrangement, is only 52 percent greater than that
for a corresponding planar wing-body combination .
unit surface deflection) of the cruciform wing-body arrangement
having four equally deflected panels is therefore 94 percent of
the corresponding planar wing-body combination .
