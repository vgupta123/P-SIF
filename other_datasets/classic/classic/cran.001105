numerical solutions for supersonic flow of an ideal
gas around blunt two-dimensional bodies .
  the method described is an inverse one,. the shock shape is chosen
and the solution proceeds downstream to a body .  bodies blunter than
circular cylinders are readily accessible, and any adiabatic index can
be chosen .  the lower limit to the free-stream mach number available in
any case is determined by the extent of the subsonic field, which in
turn depends upon the body shape .  some discussion of the stability of
the numerical processes is given .  a set of solutions for flows about
circular cylinders at several mach numbers and several values of the
adiabatic index is included .
