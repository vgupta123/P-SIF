incompressible wedge flows of an electrically conducting
viscous fluid in the presence of a magnetic field .
  the purpose of this note is to discuss the two-dimensional
flow of an electrically conducting viscous fluid past a wedge
in the presence of a magnetic field .  the governing differential
equations and boundary conditions are given and analyzed .
