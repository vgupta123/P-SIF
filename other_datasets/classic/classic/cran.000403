magnetohydrodynamic shock waves .
  an interpretation of the de hoffman-teller shock-wave
equations for an infinitely conducting
medium is given analogous to the classical interpretation of
the ordinary hydrodynamic shock-wave
equations of rankine and hugoniot .  two cases of interest
are considered as a consequence of this theory .
it is shown that weak magnetic fields in interstellar clouds
will be amplified, and, if external mechanisms
are available to reduce the compressional effects of shock
waves, the field will reach a value,
where p is the pressure .  also, some aspects of the internal
motions of prominences are considered ,. it is
shown that gauss will yield results in accord with
the observational material .
