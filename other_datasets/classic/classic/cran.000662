theoretical and experimental investigation of
aerodynamic-heating and isothermal heat transfer parameters on
a hemisphere nose with laminar boundary layer at supersonic
mach numbers .
  the effect of a strong, negative
pressure gradient upon the local
rate of heat transfer through a laminar
boundary layer on the isothermal
surface of an electrically heated,
cylindrical body of revolution with a
hemispherical nose was determined from
wind-tunnel tests at a mach number
of 1.97 .  the investigation indicated
that the local heat-transfer
parameter, based on flow conditions
just outside the boundary layer,
decreased from a value of 0.65 0.10 at
the stagnation point of the
hemisphere to a value  of 0.43 0.05 at the
junction with the cylindrical
afterbody .  because measurements of the
static pressure distribution over
the hemisphere indicated that the local
flow pattern tended to become
stationary as the free-stream mach number
was increased to 3.8, this
distribution of heat-transfer parameter is
believed representative of all
mach numbers greater than 1.97 and of
temperatures less than that of
dissociation .  the local heat-transfer
parameter was independent of reynolds
number based on body diameter in the
range from 0.6x10 to 2.3x10 .
  the measured distribution of
heat-transfer parameter agreed within
theoretical distribution calculated with
foreknowledge only of the pressure
distribution about the body .  this
method, applicable to any body of
revolution with an isothermal surface,
combines the mangler transformation,
stewartson transformation, and thermal
solutions to the falkner-skan wedge-flow
problem, and thus evaluates the
heat-transfer rate in axisymmetric
compressible flow in terms of the known
heat-transfer rate in an approximately
equivalent two-dimensional
incompressible flow .
  measurements of recovery-temperature
distributions at mach numbers
of 1.97 and 3.04 yielded local recovery
factors having an average value
of 0.823 0.012 on the hemisphere which
increased abruptly at the shoulder
to an average value of 0.840 0.012 on
the cylindrical afterbody .  this
result suggests that the usual representation
of the laminar recovery
factor as the square root of the prandtl
number is conservative in the
presence of a strong, accelerating pressure gradient .
