  combined free and forced convective heat
transfer in vertical channels has been studied by many
researchers .  due to the need for engineering design
information there have been many papers concerning
cases of fully developed flow with varying wall
temperature .  forced flows in a channel of electrically
conducting fluid with a transverse magnetic field
have been studied and the large effects of a magnetic
field on the flow pattern have been established .
  flows of combined free and forced convection in
electrically conducting fluids in vertical channels
with a transverse magnetic field are expected to
attract attention in future engineering applications, for
example, in a magneto-hydrodynamic generator or in
plasma studies .  however, except for a report by
gershuni and zhukhovitskii (1) concerning a
particular case, no general study has been published .
  this paper is a general treatment of fully
developed, free and forced convective, laminar,
magneto-hydrodynamic flow in a vertical channel with a
transverse magnetic field .  it includes combined free and
forced convective flows in channels without a
magnetic field reported by ostrach (2), tao (3), etc. as
special cases .  hartmann flow (4) is included in the
other limit .
