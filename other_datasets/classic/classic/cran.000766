experimental investigation at mach number of 3. 0 of
effects of thermal stress and buckling on flutter characteristics
of flat single-bay panels of length-width ratio 0. 96 .
  flat, single-bay, skin stiffener
panels with length-width ratios of 0.96
were tested at a mach number of 3.0,
at dynamic pressures ranging from 1,500 to
stagnation temperatures from 300 f to
effects of thermal stress and buckling on the
flutter of such panels .  the panel
supporting structure allowed partial thermal
expansion of the skins in both the
longitudinal and lateral directions .  panel
skin material and skin thickness were varied .
  a boundary faired through the
experimental flutter points consisted of a
flat-panel portion, a buckled-panel
portion, and a transition point, at the
intersection of the two boundaries,
where a panel is most susceptible to flutter .
the flutter region consisted of two
fairly distinct sections, a large-amplitude
flutter region and a small-amplitude
flutter region .  the results show that an
increase in panel skin temperature
flutter .  the flutter trend for buckled
panels is reversed .  use of a modified
temperature parameter, which approximately
accounts for the effects of differential
pressure and variations in panel skin
material and skin thickness, reduced the
scatter in the data which resulted when
these effects were neglected .  the results
are compared with an exact theory for
clamped panels for the condition of zero
midplane stress .  in addition, a
two-mode /transtability/ solution for clamped
panels is compared with the
experimentally determined transition point .
