simple shear flow past a flat plate in an incompressible fluid of small
viscosity .
in the study of high-speed viscous flow past a two-dimensional body it
is usually necessary to consider a curved shock wave emitting from the
nose or leading edge of the body .  consequently, there exists an
inviscid rotational flow region between the shock wave and the boundary
layer .  such a situation arises, for instance, in the study of the
hypersonic viscous flow past a flat plate .  the situation is somewhat
different from prandtl's classical boundary-layer problem . in prandtl's
original problem the inviscid free stream outside the boundary layer is
irrotational while in a hypersonic boundary-layer problem the inviscid
free stream must be considered as rotational .  the possible effects of
vorticity have been recently discussed by ferri and libby .  in the
present paper, the simple shear flow past a flat plate in a fluid of small
viscosity is investigated .  it can be shown that this problem can again
be treated by the boundary-layer approximation, the only novel feature
being that the free stream has a constant vorticity .  the discussion
here is restricted to two-dimensional incompressible steady flow .
