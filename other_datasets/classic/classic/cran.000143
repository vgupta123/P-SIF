interplanetary orbits .
  the basic equations under simplified
conditions for interplanetary flight are derived .
for a voyage from planet to planet an
unlimited number of orbits is possible .  in
order to give a clear survey of these possible
orbits a diagram is developed from which the
approximate energy-requirement, the duration,
and other particulars of a voyage can be
easily found .
