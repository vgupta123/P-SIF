The 'Half-Life' of Periodical Literature:  
Apparent and Real Obsolescence
  The expression 'half-life', borrowed from physics, has appeared
quite frequently in the literature on documentation since 1960, when an
article by Burton and Kebler on The 'half-life' of some scientific and technical
literatures was published, although it had certainly been used previously.
Burton and Kebler point out that literature becomes obsolescent rather than
disintegrating (as in its original meaning), so that 'half-life' means 'half the
active life', and this is commonly understood as meaning the time during
which one-half of the currently active literature was published.  Numerous
studies have been carried out, mainly by the analysis of citations, to establish
obsolescence rates of the literature of different subjects.  Bourne points out
that different studies have given widely different results, so that many of the
'half-life' figures reported are not valid beyond the particular sample of
literature or users surveyed; certainly they cannot be used as accurate
measures for discriminating between different subject-fields.
