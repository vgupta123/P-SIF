Automated Language Processing
  The idea for Automated Language Processing was suggested in 1964 at a
time when the research efforts in information storage and retrieval were
expanding at System Development Corporation.  Many people in the company
were directly interested in this area, and an even larger group had interests
that were tangentially related.  A quick and effective means of acquainting
them with the state-of-the-art was needed, but no convenient compilation
of relevant material was available.  It was agreed that a book on the
theory and techniques of information storage and retrieval procedures would
be a worthwhile project for the language processing staff to undertake.
Although no one member could reasonably be expected to cover the entire
range of technical developments in this field, the staff as a whole is
concerned with most phases of the work.  This is attested by the fact that
all but one of the chapter authors were connected with SDC either as
employees or consultants.  The single exception is Pendergraft, for SDC
has had no sustained project in machine translation.  SDC Management was
enthusiastic in its support of the new project.
