The Human Side of Enterprise
    This volume is an attempt to substantiate the thesis that the
human side of enterprise is "all of a piece" - that the theoretical
assumptions management holds about controlling its human resources
determine the whole character of the enterprise.  They determine
also the quality of its successive generations of management.
    Of course the process is circular, and herein lies the possibility
and the hope of future progress.  The key question for top management
is:  "What are your assumptions (implicit as well as explicit) about
the most effective way to manage people?"  From the answer to this
question flow the answers to the questions Mr. Sloan raised in our
discussion about the making of managers, as well as answers to many
other questions which perplex and confound management as it seeks to
achieve more successfully the economic objectives of enterprise.  It
will be clear to the reader that I believe many of our present assumptions
about the most effective way to manage people are far from adequate.
