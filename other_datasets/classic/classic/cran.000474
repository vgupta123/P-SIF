laminar mixing of a compressible fluid .
laminar mixing of a compressible fluid .
a theoretical investigation of the velocity profiles for laminar
mixing of a high-velocity stream with a region of fluid at rest
has been made assuming that the prandtl number is unity .  a method
which involves only quadratures is presented for calculating the
velocity profile in the mixing layer for an arbitrary value of the
free-stream mach number .
detailed velocity profiles have been calculated for free-stream mach
numbers of 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 .  for each mach number, velocity profiles
are presented for both a linear and a 0.76-power variation of viscosity
with absolute temperature .  the calculations for a linear variation are
much simpler than those for a 0.76-power variation .  it is shown that
by selecting the constant of proportionality in the linear approximation
such that it gives the correct value for the viscosity in the
high-temperature part of the mixing layer, the resulting velocity profiles
are in excellent agreement with those calculated by a 0.76-power
variation .
