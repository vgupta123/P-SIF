Numerical Solution of Nonlinear Two-Point
Boundary Problems by Finite Difference Methods
Solution of nonlinear two-point boundary-value
problems is often an extremely difficult task. 
 Quite apart from questions of reality and uniqueness,
there is no established numerical technique for 
this problem.  At present, shooting techniques are the
easiest method of attacking these problems.  When 
these fail, the more difficult method of finite differences
can often be used to obtain a solution.  
This paper gives examples and discusses the finite difference
method for non-linear two-point boundary-value 
problems.
