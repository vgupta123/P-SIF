  This paper examines the implications of the findings of evaluative tests
regarding the retrieval performance of natural language in various subject
fields.  It suggests parallel investigations into the structure of natural
language, with particular reference to terminology, as used in the different
branches of basic science.  The criteria for defining the terminological
consistency of a subject are formulated and a measure suggested for
determining the degree of terminological consistency.
  The terminological and information structures of specific disciplines such
as, chemistry, physics, botany, zoology, and geology; the circumstances in
which terms originate; and the efforts made by the international scientific
community to standardize the terminology in their respective disciplines -
are examined in detail.  This investigation shows why and how an artificially
created scientific language finds it impossible to keep pace with current
developments and thus points to the source of natural language.
