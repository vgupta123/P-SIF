Analysis of the Microstructure of Titles in the INSPEC Data-Base
   A high degree of constancy has been found to exist in the microstructure of 
titles of samples of the INSPEC data-base taken over 3-year period.. Character
and diagram frequencies are shown to be relatively stable, while variable-length
character-string characterizing samples separated by 3 years in time show close
similarities..
