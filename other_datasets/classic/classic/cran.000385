on a generalised porous-wall ?couette type? flow .
  in a recent paper, the problem of a /couette-type/ flow in
which the fixed wall is porous has been considered .  the
results quoted in the above reference can be obtained rigorously
by the method stated below in which a different interpretation to
one of the parameters is made .
