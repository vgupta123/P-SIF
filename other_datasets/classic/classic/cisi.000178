The Automation Survey: Background and Conclusions
  During the past decade the Library of Congress, in
common with many other research libraries, has become
increasingly aware of pressures and strains in
many of its operations.  These areas of concern (well
known to librarians) include mounting arrearages in
cataloguing and other processing activities; increasing
complexity of manual inventory control files;
increasing difficulty in keeping card catalogues 
reasonably current and accurate; and
increasing demands for a wide variety of services
for a clientele whose needs for information
have grown tremendously since World War II,
and many of whom have only recently turned to
large research libraries for help.  Five years ago an
internal committee of the Library of Congress was
charged to study potential applications of electronic
data processing equipment to Library procedures;
subsequently representatives of three computer firms
made brief studies of Library operations which 
intimated that certain areas could benefit substantially
by automation.
