Automated Alternatives to Card Catalogs: The Current State of Planning and
Implementation
   The results of a study carried out under the auspices of the Council on 
Library Resources are described.. The stated goal of this study was to 
determine and analyze the current state of planning and implementation for 
computer-generated replacements for the card catalog (book catalog, microimage
catalog, on-line catalog) for large collections (250,000 titles or more) and
selected smaller libraries (less than 250,000 titles) that had actually
implemented an alternative form of catalog..
