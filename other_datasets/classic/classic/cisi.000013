I am not, nor have I ever pretended to be, an expert on
microfiche.  Nevertheless, when I was invited to address the
Third Annual Northeastern DDC/Industry Users Conference in
Waltham, Massachusetts in April of 1968 I had the temerity to
attempt to describe what I as a user would like to have in a
fiche reader.  ("Towards a Uniform Federal Report Numbering
System and a Cuddly Microfiche Reader--Two Modest Proposals."
