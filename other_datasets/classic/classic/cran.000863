loads and deformations of buckled rectangular plates .
  the nonlinear large deflection equations of von karman for plates
are converted into a set of linear equations by expanding the
displacements into a power series in terms of an arbitrary parameter .  the
post-buckling behavior of simply supported rectangular plates subjected
to longitudinal compression and to a uniform temperature rise is
investigated in detail by solving the first few of the equations .
  experimental data are presented for the compression problem .
comparisons are made for total shortening and local strains and deflections
which indicate good agreement between experimental and theoretical
results .
