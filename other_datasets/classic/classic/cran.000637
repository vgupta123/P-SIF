an integral equation relating the general time-dependent lift and
downwash distributions on finite wings in subsonic flow .
an integral equation for obtaining the unsteady air forces on finite
wings in subsonic compressible flow is presented .  this equation
is applicable for any arbitrary time-dependent motion and can be
utilized for flexible as well as rigid wings .  the approach involves
the derivation of an integral equation relating the unknown pressure
the form of the equation is such that it should lend itself readily to
modern high-speed computers for obtaining pressure distributions .
special cases of the integral equation are treated for two-dimensional
incompressible flow and are presented in an appendix .
