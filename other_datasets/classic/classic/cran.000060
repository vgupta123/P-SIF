estimation forces and moments due to rolling for several
slender tail configurations at supersonic speeds .
  the velocity potentials, span loadings, and corresponding force
and moment derivatives have been theoretically evaluated for a number
of slender-tail arrangements performing a steady rolling motion at
supersonic speeds .
  the method of analysis is based upon an application of
conformal-transformation techniques .  the utilization of these techniques allows
the simple determination of the complex potentials for various types
of two-dimensional boundary-value problems .
  in addition, two simple and often-used approximations to the
rolling derivatives have been compared with the corresponding exact
values determined by the method presented in this report .
  in order to show the importance of wing-tail interference, the
effect of the flow field behind a rolling wing on the tail
characteristics has been illustrated for a simple wing-tail arrangement .
