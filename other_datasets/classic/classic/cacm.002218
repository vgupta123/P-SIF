An Analysis of Some Time-Sharing Techniques
The effectiveness of certain time-sharing techniques
such as program, relocation, disk rotational 
delay minimization, and swap volume minimization is
investigated.  Summary data is presented, and the 
findings are discussed.  The vehicle for this investigation
was a SIMULA based simulation model reflecting 
an early framework for a planned Burroughs B6500 time-sharing
system.  Inasmuch as the B6500 system is 
based upon the use of variable sized segments and a
dynamic overlay procedure, data is also presented 
which provides some indication of the effectiveness of this
type of organization in a time-sharing environment. 
 The design characteristics and operational capabilities
of the simulation model are also described.
