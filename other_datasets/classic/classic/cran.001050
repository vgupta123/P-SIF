compressive buckling of simply supported curved plates
and cylinders of sandwich construction .
compressive buckling of simply supported curved plates
and cylinders of sandwich construction .
  theoretical solutions are presented
for the buckling in uniform
axial compression of two types of simply
supported curved sandwich
plates ..  the corrugated-core type and the
isotropic-core type .  the
solutions are obtained from a theory for
orthotropic curved plates in
which deflections due to shear are taken
into account .  results are
given in the form of equations and curves .
