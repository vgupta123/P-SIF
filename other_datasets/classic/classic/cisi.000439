Research Studies in Patterns of Scientific Communication: I.
General Description of Research Program
   This article is the first in a series which described the general procedures 
and some findings of over seventy studies which we conducted from 1966 to 1971 
on the information-exchange activities of over 12000 scientists and engineers 
in a sample of nine physical, social and engineering sciences.. We designed the
studies so that (a) the full spectrum of scientific communication media could 
be explored, (b) the various studies were coupled in order that data obtained
from one study could be directly related to those obtained from other studies,
(c) the scheduling of the studies was conducted in real time in order that the 
same body of information could be followed from its inception to its final 
integration into the general body of scientific knowledge, and (d) the same 
studies were conducted for all nine disciplines being studied in order that 
genuine comparisons could be made among them.. The data are now stored on
machine-readable magnetic tapes and will be made available to scholars in the 
field of information science..
