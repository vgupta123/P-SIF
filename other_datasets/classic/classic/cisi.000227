A Behavioral Theory of the Firm
  This book is about the business firm and the way it makes 
economic decisions.  We propose to make detailed observations
of the procedures by which firms make decisions and
to use these observations as a basis for a theory of decision
making within business organizations.  Our articles of faith
are simple.  We believe that, in order to understand contemporary
economic decision making, we need to supplement
the study of market factors with an examination of
the internal operation of the firm - to study the effects of
organizational structure and conventional practice on the
development of goals, the formation of expectations, and
the execution of choices.
