helium injection into the boundary layer at an axisymmetric
stagnation point .
  this report presents a theoretical analysis of the boundary
layer at an axisymmetric stagnation point with large rates of
helium injection .  the exact stagnation-point boundary-layer
equations are integrated numerically with approximate
representations of the gas properties .  the treatment of the
two-point boundary-value problem employed herein is shown to be
useful for various boundary-layer and mixing problems .  the
exact solutions indicate that for large rates of injection the
boundary layer can be represented by a thick, inner layer of
constant shear, temperature, and composition and by a relatively
thin outer region in which the flow variables adjust to their
free-stream values .  an inviscid-flow model is shown to lead to
accurate predictions of this shear layer and will thus provide
sufficiently accurate profiles for use in the study of the downstream
influence of stagnation-point mass transfer .  the heat transfer
to the stagnation point is also considered .  tabulations of the
eigenvalues for a variety of wall conditions and injection rates
are given .
