A Comparison of List-Processing Computer Languages
(Including a Detailed Comparison of COMIT, 
IPL-V, LISP 1.5, and SLIP)
A detailed comparison is presented of COMIT,
IPL-V, LISP 1.5 and SLIP - four well-known computer 
programming languages which, among them, exhibit all the
principal characteristics of existing list-processing 
languages.  Important common features of list-processing
languages are reviewed: forms of data structures 
which are manipulated, necessity for dynamic allocation
of storage, use of pushdown stores, and use of 
recursive operations.  Principal differences between the
four languages under consideration are detailed: 
representations of data, both by the programmer and within
the machine; methods for storage allocation; 
programming formalisms and special processes available,
including arithmetic facilities; and usability 
in terms of availability, documentation, learning aids
and debugging facilities.  A rough comparison 
shows that all the languages discussed have approximately
the same speed.  Finally, the authors give 
some heuristics to aid in the selection of one of these
languages for use in particular problem applications, 
concluding that no one of the languages considered is
distinctly superior in all possible list-processing 
applications.
