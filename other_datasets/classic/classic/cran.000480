adiabatic wall temperature due to mass transfer cooling with a
combustible gas .
a recent technical note by sutton (1), with the above title, discusses
the influence of the burning of a transpiration coolant on the quantity
of coolant necessary to maintain a given wall temperature .  the present
note discusses the same problem in a way which has been found useful
in calculating the burning rates of solid and liquid fuels (2) .
consider the transpiration cooling of a porous surface in a gas stream .
then a simple modification of the general mass .
