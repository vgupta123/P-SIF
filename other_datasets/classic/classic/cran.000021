on heat transfer in slip flow .
a number of authors have considered the effect of slip on the heat
transfer and skin friction in a laminar boundary layer over a flat plate .
reference 1 considers this by a perturbation on the usual laminar
boundary-layer analysis while some other studies.dash e.g., reference
the impulsive motion of an infinite plate .
