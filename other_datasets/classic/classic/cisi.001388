Structure of Discourse
This monograph studies the external links between the sentences within a
paragraph.
Two basic problems are solved:	a formal apparatus for deriving simplified
versions of the text's phrases is devised and the regularities in the
formation of word strings are determined.
Also considers future developments in the field of automatized abstracting.
