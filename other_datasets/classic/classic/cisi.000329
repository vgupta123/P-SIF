The identification of variable-length, equifrequent character strings in a
natural language data base
   The words of natural language texts exhibit a Poisson (or Zipfian) rank-
frequency relationship, i.e., a small number of common words accounts for a 
large proportion of word occurrences, while a large number of the words occur 
as singletons or only infrequently.. Inverted-file retrieval systems using free
text data bases commonly identify words as the keys or index terms about which 
the file is inverted, and through which access is provided.. They therefore 
involve large and growing dictionaries and many entail inefficient utilization
of storage because of the distribution characteristics..
   An alternative approach may be based on the analysis of text in terms of
sets of variable-length character strings, the frequency distributions of
which are much less disparate than those of words.. This could lead to 
substantial reductions in dictionary size, and increased efficiency both in 
dictionary look-up times and storage utilization.
