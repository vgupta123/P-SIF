Analysis of Interleaved Memory Systems Using Blockage Buffers
A model of interleaved memory systems is presented,
and the analysis of the model by Monte 
Carlo simulation is discussed.  The simulations investigate
the performance of various system structures, 
i.e. schemes for sending instruction and data requests
to the memory system.  Performance is measured 
by determining the distribution of the number of memory
modules in operation during a memory cycle.  
An important observation from these investigations is that
separately grouping instruction and data requests 
for memory can substantially increase the average number
of memory modules in operation during a memory 
cycle.  Results of the simulations and an analytical
study are displayed for various system structures.
