mass transfer cooling at mach number 4. 8.
mass-transfer experiments on a 5 mil wire porous cone
of 20 total angle have been conducted at using
air and helium injection .  details of the experimental technique
are described in references 1 and 2 .  in the laminar boundary
layer the recovery factors and heat-transfer coefficients measured
with zero injection agreed within per cent with theory .
transition reynolds numbers observed on the porous cone with
zero injection were half as large as observed on a smooth,
impermeable model of identical geometry in the same channel, but
injection of large amounts of air or helium did not cause
transition to move forward from its zero-injection position on the
porous cone .  distributed roughness of this type apparently does
not disturb impermeable wall theory, but it masks whatever
effective roughness may be caused by discrete pore injection .
