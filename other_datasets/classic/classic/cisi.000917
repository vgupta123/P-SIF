Library Automation Systems
    This book is intended as a reasonably comprehensive discussion
of library automation systems for the librarian without previous
knowledge or experience in the field, and for the intelligent layman.
Library automation systems, in the context of this work, are 
combinations of electronic data processing machines and appropriate
programs and operating procedures, organized to work together in
carrying out, with a minimum of human intervention, some well-defined
library process.  It is a field that many thoughtful observers feel
has reached a certain maturity, and so deserves to have its portrait
made.
