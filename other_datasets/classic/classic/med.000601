the influence of blood glucose on the plasma
concentration of growth hormone
a. berson, m.d.
a sensitive and specific assay method has been used to
demonstrate acute changes in plasma hgh in normal and diabetic subjects.
hgh secretion is suppressed by glucose administration
and markedly stimulated by hypoglycemia, by interference
with intracellular glucose utilization.  high levels of hgh
were also observed during prolonged fasting, after exercise,
and four to six hours following oral glucose administration.
abnormalities in hgh secretion were found in association
with acromegaly and obesity, and following section of the
hypophyseal stalk.
the half time for disappearance of endogenous plasma
hgh is twenty to thirty minutes.
