A Study of the Characteristics, Cost and Magnitude of
Interlibrary Loans in Academic Libraries
  The investigation of interlibrary loans among academic libraries was
initiated by the Interlibrary Loan Study Committee of the Association of
Research Libraries.  It was seen as a fundamental first step toward the
solution of current problems and the exploration of the means to improve
interlibrary loan services nationally.  This report provides solid
information that is basic to any future planning at the national level.
