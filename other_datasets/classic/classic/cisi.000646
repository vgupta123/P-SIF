Performing Evaluation Studies in Information Science
   This paper considers conceptual and methodological components of information 
science evaluation studies.. The paper discusses the judgmental process of 
evaluation and the scientific nature of evaluation study in the context of 
purpose statements; criteria; the selection of variables and data collection 
and analysis techniques; and requirements of validity, reproducibility and 
reliability..  Industrial value analysis/engineering methodology is described
and related to assessments of information products and services.. The
state-of-the-art of evaluation study in information science is analyzed with 
respect to 1.the scope of evaluation studies; 2. the use of laboratory-type
environments; 3. the use of surrogate judges; 4. selection of variables; 5.
frequency of study; and 6. comparabilty of study results.. Evaluation study is
seen as essential to the management of information centers and systems and as
having approachable growth potential..
