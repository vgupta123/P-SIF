an approximate solution of the supersonic blunt body
problem for prescribed arbitrary axisymmetric shapes .
  the integral method of belotserkovskii has been carried out to
the first approximation for arbitrary blunt axisymmetric bodies
in supersonic or hypersonic flight .  this method is direct, in
that it gives the surface-pressure distribution and shock shape for
a prescribed body .  results obtained by numerical integration
for several body shapes at several mach numbers are compared
to experimental results with good agreement .  it is also shown
that the method can be successfully applied to pointed bodies
with attached shock .  in the stagnation region, simple
relationships are found from the equations of the first approximation
which connect the surface-velocity gradient, shock curvature,
shock-detachment distance, and body curvature .  these
relations are also correlated with experiment for a variety of shapes
as a function of mach number .  the correlations permit a rapid
estimate of the stagnation-point velocity gradient, important for
heat-transfer calculations, for any blunt body from the shock
stand-off distance .  a method for a higher approximation is
described, for which, in contrast to the higher approximations of
belotserkovskii, a large number of simultaneous total differential
equations with unknown parameters does not occur .  one form
of this method has been studied numerically .  results are given
which, though only partially successful, indicate the amount of
improvement to be expected from a higher approximation .
