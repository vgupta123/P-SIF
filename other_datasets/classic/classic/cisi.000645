Creation and Use of Citation Data Bases: A Modest Proposal
   Improvement in the production and use of citations to research literature 
calls for coordination of activities by a number of abstracting and indexing 
services.. The Ohio College Library Center (OCLC) has developed a cost-effective
on-line shared cataloging system, now in widespread use by U.S. libraries.. It 
could readily serve as a pattern for a system to create and share descriptive 
indexing on-line.. A proposed system is outlined, possible developers are noted,
and further action is urged..
