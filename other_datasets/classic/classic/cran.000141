free-flight techniques for high speed aerodynamic research .
  the development rocket-borne and rocket-launched high-speed
airplane model test is described .  details of airborne components,
telemetering units, tracking, and their calibration are also discussed .
tests on controls, drag measurements, longitudinal stability
evaluations, lift measurements, pressure measurements, aeroelastic
estimations, and sonic bang recordings are effected .  the reynolds numbers
involved are much higher than are usual in the wind tunnel, and
extensions of mach numbers are obtained beyond the tunnel limits, both free
of the tunnel wall interference .
