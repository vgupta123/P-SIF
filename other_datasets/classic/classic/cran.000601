calculation of the flow past slender delta wings with
leading edge separation .
  the flow past a slender delta
wing with a sharp leading edge, at
incidence, usually separates along
this edge, i.e. a vortex layer extends
from the edge and rolls up to form
a /core/ (a region of high vorticity) .
a potential flow model of this is
constructed in which the layer is
replaced by a vortex sheet which
is rolled up into a spiral in the region
of the /core/ .  this problem
is reduced to a two-dimensional one by
assuming a conical field and using
slender wing theory .  the shape and strength
of the sheet are determined by
the two conditions that it is a stream
surface and sustains no pressure
difference .  use is made of results
previously obtained for the core
region and the remaining finite part of
the sheet is dealt with by choosing
certain functions for its shape and
strength .  the parameters in these
functions are found by satisfying the
two conditions stated above at
isolated points .  results are obtained for
the pressure distribution, chord
loading and norman force coefficient as
functions of the ratio of the
incidence to the apex angle .  the lift for a
given incidence is about 15
below that found by brown and michael .  flow
patterns are indicated in two
typical cases .  the effect of separation on
the drag due to lift of a wing
with small thickness is discussed .
