Implementing Quicksort Programs
This paper is a practical study of how to
implement the Quicksort sorting algorithm and its 
best variants on real computers, including how to apply
various code optimization techniques.  A detailed 
implementation combining the most effective improvements
to Quicksort is given, along with a discussion 
of how to implement it in assembly language.  Analytic
results describing the performance of the programs 
are summarized.  A variety of special situations are considered
from a practical standpoint to illustrate 
Quicksort's wide applicability as an internal sorting
method which requires negligible extra storage.
