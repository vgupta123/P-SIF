Computer Generation of Wiswesser Line Notation.
II. Polyfused, Perifused, and Chained Ring Structure
   The computer program for the generation of Weswesser Line Notation (WLN) has
been extended to include polyfused rings, methyl contraction rules, chain of 
two ring systems, some perifused rings, some chelates, and some metallocences..
Salts and ions are also handled, but in a different manner than what is normally
found.. Multipliers are not used by the program.. The normal input for the WLN
generation is an easy input program using a Rand Tablet; however, teletype and 
connection table input can also be used in most cases..
