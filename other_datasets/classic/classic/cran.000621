latitude and diurnal variations of air densities from 190 to 280 km.
as derived from the orbits of discoverer satellites .
variations in air density between day and night in the region 190 to 280
 km are found to be small/less than about 25(/ . the presence of a
possible region of local heating at about 220 km which disappears at
night . the night-time density profile conforms with a constant scale
height of 35/2/km.no definite variation of air density with latitude is
evident apart from a possible increase of about 60(, which is indicated
by rather limited polar-region data . for other latitudes and seasons a
variation of less than about 20( is indicated .
