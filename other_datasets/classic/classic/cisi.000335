Conceptual Basis of the Classification of Knowledge
  As far as philosophers are concerned, the Conference seems to be justified
precisely because of the present state of the Classification of Knowledge.  For
two thousand years, the Classification of Knowledge has been a major
philosophical problem.  Lately, it has evolved from a philosophical
preoccupation into a specialized technique, a species of the general techniques 
of classification, far removed from philosophical preoccupations and equally
ignored by philosophers.  At the present time there exist powerful technical
models of classification and highly developed classifications of various
branches of knowledge.  What is lacking is a satisfactory general
classification of knowledge and an adequate clarification of the philosophical
problems underlying such classification.  The need for clarification is
important from the theoretical as well as practical point of view because
the general systems of classification of knowledge depend on theories of
knowledge.  It is therefore highly desirable that philosophers and specialists
in classification get together and discuss problems of common interest.
