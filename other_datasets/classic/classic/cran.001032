on the conservativeness of various distributed force systems .
the necessity of determining the conservativeness of force systems in
instability problems is discussed in reference 1 .  it is shown that,
whereas kinetic methods are generally applicable for the determination
of instability loads, the statical methods usually employed are valid
only for conservative and nongyroscopic systems .  small changes in
the character of the loading could make an otherwise conservative
system nonconservative and cause a large change in the magnitude of the
buckling load .  the buckling load of the cantilever column example
in reference 1 is, for tangential end loading, eight times that for
conservative, constant directional loading .
