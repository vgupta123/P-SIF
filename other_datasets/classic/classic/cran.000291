sweepback effects in the turbulent boundary-layer shock-wave
interaction .
  experiments are reported on the interaction of turbulent
boundary layers and shock waves with sweptback configurations .
they show that the peak pressure rise at separation, the
upstream influence ahead of separation, and the pressure rise at
reattachment for moderate sweep angles can all be understood by
simple extensions of available two-dimensional theories .
