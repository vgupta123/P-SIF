A Computer_Aided Information Service for Nuclear Science and Technology
   The computerized information centre of the European Atomic Energy Community
has become operational.. A survey of its principal characteristics is given, and
the main problems that arose in the development phase of the system are 
discussed.. The Euratom Thesaurus includes graphic representation of 
relationships between indexing terms.. A dual vocabulary allows specific 
indexing for high relevance and generic indexing for high recall.. Retrieval 
strategy involves utilization of Boolean operators and frequency-of-occurrence 
tables.. Recall ration can be determined graphically by a continuous approach 
method.. Indexing consistency tests show that it pays to use subject 
specialists.. User's needs are discussed in terms of subject coverage, 
specificity, rapidity, and presentation.. The user service comprises 
retrospective searches on request as well as customer profile service on 
subscription.. There are three types of relevance, and various ways of bringing
system relevance to coincide with user relevance.. The Centre's budgetary 
requirements are low, due to circumspect use of its computer, an IBM 360, model
40.. Its aims are centralization of documentation in the nuclear field and
international co-operation..
