a simple method of matric structural analysis, part
iv, non-linear problems .
  the method presented in the previous parts is employed to
solve various kinds of nonlinear problems, such as problems
concerning large deflections or buckling, or thermal creep, or
inelastic stress redistribution involving thermal gradients, or
design .  the procedure used in each case is one of direct
iteration--i. e., after one assumes a starting point all subsequent cycles are
self-generating .  simple numerical examples are worked out .
