The Computer/Library Interface: the Last Five Years
  University printing presses exist, and are subsidized by the Government for
the purpose of producing books which no one can read; and they are true to their
high calling.  Books are the sources of material for lectures.  They should be
kept from the young; for to read books and remember what you read, well
enough to reproduce it, is called 'cramming', and this is destructive of all 
true education.  The best way to protect the young from books, is, first, to 
make them in such a way that no one can find them without several years' 
training.  A lecturer is a sound scholar, who is chosen to teach on the ground
that he was once able to learn.  Eloquence is not permissible in a lecture; it
is a privilege reserved by stature for the Public Orator.
