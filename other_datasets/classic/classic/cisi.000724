Document Access
  Long-range, copies of needed documents will be rapidly and inexpensively
supplied to users in libraries or at their desks by querying an electronic
network linking document sources (central libraries and publishers).  In the
interim, local libraries will slowly progress through increased dependence
on local holdings of microfilm to development of and dependence on regional,
national, and discipline networks for access to most of the documents desired.
These developments will depend, however, on resolution of the copyright problem
by mechanisms that will fairly remunerate the copyright owners.  As background,
and because radical change is not expected overnight, the paper also reviews
conventional and sophisticated storage systems, including microfilm, facsimile,
and video; copyright aspects; costs; need for speed; other user considerations;
and standards.
