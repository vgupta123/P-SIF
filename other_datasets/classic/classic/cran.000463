physical properties of plastics for photo-thermoelastic
investigation .
  the optical and physical properties of
paraplex p43, castolite, and epoxy resin
hysol 6000-op, which are potentially of
interest in photothermoelastic investigations,
were investigated over a temperature range
from +100 to -60 f .  results on the
thermal-expansion coefficient, the material
fringe value, and the modulus of elasticity
as functions of temperature are presented .
also evaluated were thermal properties of
importance in heat conduction .  photothermoelastic
figures of merit, which rate the
optical sensitivity of materials in photothermoelastic
applications, as well as a new
method to determine this figure in a relative manner are presented .
