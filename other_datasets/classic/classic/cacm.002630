On Computing Sets of Shortest Paths in a Graph
Two algorithms are presented that construct
the k shortest paths between every pair of vertices 
in a directed graph.  These algorithms generalize the Floyd
algorithm and the Dantzig algorithm for finding 
the shortest path between every pair of vertices in a directed graph.
