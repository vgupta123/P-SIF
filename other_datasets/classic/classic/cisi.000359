Documentation
  More than half a century ago La Fontaine and Otlet started
their lives' work, which at first was connected with the term
"bibliography," but to which gradually the work "Documentation"
was attributed.  What they developed was of a far wider scope
than the establishment of a new technique dealing with printed
and non-printed documents.
  The great deal which inspired them, and those who worked
side by side with them, was to render accessible the totality of
what is crystallized from human thought and to make of it a
common treasure of mankind, serving to bring mutual comprehension
and to build for peace by the co-operation of all men of goodwill
of all nations.
  It was in this spirit that my friend Bradford joined those men,
whose noble faces have passed and to whom it never was given to
see the achievement of the work to which they devoted their lives.
  And it was in this spirit that Bradford, thanks to his knowledge
and experience as scientist as well as librarian, not only
gave his strong and valuable support to the common work but
added to it fundamental and constructive new elements.
  Just for this reason the present book we owe to him gives far
more than a mere compilation of facts and experiences.  Such
a compilation would indeed be welcome because, curiously
enough, up to now, there is no good general treatise on
documentation available.  But his book gives us before all things
an abundance of original ideas and creative thoughts.
