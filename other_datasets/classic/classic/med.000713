dural sinus pressure
in normal and hydrocephalic dogs
simultaneous measurement of cerebro-
spinal fluid pressure (csfp) and venous
pressure in the anterior (ssvp) and poste-
rior sagittal sinus (tvp) has demonstrated
that in the normal dog the mean pressures are
related as follows:
csfp>ssvp>tvp.  the statistical relationship between the pres-
sures has shown a poor correlation of ssvp
and tvp with changes in csfp.  on the
other hand, in the hydrocephalic dog, ssvp
rises to meet csfp and is related to fluid
pressure in a 1:1 fashion.  this could be ex-
pected to cause a "non venting" of acute
changes of csfp and a decrease in fluid ab-
sorption.  it is postulated that the mechanism
of ssvp elevation is a partial occlusion of
the sinus.
