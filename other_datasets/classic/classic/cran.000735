the bending of uniformly loaded sectorial plates with
clamped edges .
  this paper analyzes the bending of a sectorial plate,
clamped on all edges and subjected to uniformly
distributed load, by using two different methods of superposition
on the elementary solution for a uniformly loaded circular
plate with a clamped edge .
