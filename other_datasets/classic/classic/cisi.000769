Keywords and Clumps
  Recent work at the Cambridge Language Research Unit has been
concerned with the development of automatic classification procedures for
information retrieval.  This has taken the form of research into methods of
classification of keywords extracted from documents, with a view to using
the classes found for co-ordinate indexing of technical material.  We cannot
claim to have solved this problem because the methods we have been able 
to develop so far cannot be applied on a sufficiently large scale.  We have,
however, made enough progress to make us feel that this a fruitful line of
research.
