A New Linear Notation System Based on Combinations of Carbon and Hydrogen
   A new linear notation system is described which was designed to have a 
one-to-one correspondence with the chemical structures represented by the 
notations.. Each notation is unique and unambiguous, yet simple and compatible 
with computer input and output characters.. The symbols used in the notation 
system denote carbon in terms of bounds and attached hydrogen(s).. The notation 
system is illustrated with acyclic, carbocyclic, and heterocyclic examples..
