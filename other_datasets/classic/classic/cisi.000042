The Notion of Relevance
   Analysis of the problems of defining the mutual relevancies of queries and 
document-collections indicates that they essentially involve the problem of
conceptual relatedness.. In order to consider the later problem, the question 
of concept-formation is first discussed, which in turn requires a definition of
concept.. An extensional interpretation is suggested whereby a concept is 
associated with a class of conceptually-similar documents.. Users' similarity-
judgments then provide the empirical data for formal definitions of concept and
conceptual relatedness.. It is found, however, that certain very general 
difficulties rule out the possibility of defining concepts and their 
relatedness by the method proposed.. Since this method is based on human 
relevance-judgments, it seems a natural one to adopt, so that its collapse has
serious practical and theoretical consequences.. An alternative approach is 
therefore proposed whose elaboration will form Part II of this article..
