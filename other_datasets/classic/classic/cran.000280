the surface oil flow technique as used in high speed
wind tunnels in the united kingdom .
  an examination has been made of the
various versions of the surface oil
flow technique used in different high speed
wind tunnels .  to provide
background information for this investigation
some systematic tests were made on
a simple model in a small supersonic tunnel .
the experience gained made it
possible to explain many of the variations
in terms of the different operating
conditions of the tunnels .
  the time taken to form a pattern
on a typical model is, to a first
approximation, directly proportional to
the value of the parameter,
the factor being 36,000 12,000 .  the
time taken appears to be independent
of the initial thickness of the oil sheet .
  a general procedure for the development
of oil mixtures for any purpose
is suggested .
