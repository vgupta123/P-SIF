accelerating convergence of iteration processes .
accelerating convergence of iteration processes .
  a technique is discussed which, when applied to an iterative procedure
for the solution of an equation, accelerates the rate of convergence if
the iteration converges and induces convergence if the iteration
diverges .  an illustrative example is given .
