The University of Sheffield Biomedical Information Project
   An outline is given of the history of the Project and the development, with 
OSTI support, of an information service in intestinal absorption which is intended
to become self-supporting.. Results of an evaluation of computer-based current 
awareness techniques including journal scanning is discussed with reference to 
cost, completeness and minimum delay.. A simple technique is suggested for
profile construction e.g. for Chemical Titles computer search, based on 
frequency and specificity of words in a sample of relevant titles..
