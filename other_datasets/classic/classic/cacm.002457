Inductive Methodsfor Proving Properties of Programs
There are two main purposes in this paper:
first, clarification and extension of known results 
about computation of recursive programs, with emphasis
on the difference between the theoretical and 
practical approaches; second, presentation and examination
of various known methods for proving properties 
of recursive programs.  Discussed in detail are two
powerful inductive methods computational induction 
and structural induction, including examples of their applications.
