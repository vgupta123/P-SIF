approximate analysis of the slot injection of a gas
in laminar flow .
  the laminar diffusion and combustion of a gas
injected into a high-speed uniform stream by
means of a wall slot are considered .  the
dorodnitzin-howarth transformation is employed to
reduce the boundary layer equations to
incompressible form,. the nonsimilar flow field is
treated by a modified oseen approximation in
conjunction with the integral method .  thermal
boundary conditions corresponding to an adiabatic
wall and to constant wall enthalpy are
discussed .  the injection of homogeneous, heterogeneous,
nonreactive, and reactive gases is
treated .  for the latter case, the models usually
employed for chemical behavior, namely,
frozen and equilibrium flow, are considered .  the
analysis is applicable to a wide variety of
laminar flows, e.g., those involving cooling, thermal
protection, skin-friction reduction, and
supersonic deflagration .  a numerical example of
practical interest in connection with the
venting of gaseous hydrogen boiloff from a rocket
booster is presented .
