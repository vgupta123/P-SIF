on the minimisation and numerical evaluation of wave
drag .
  a fourier analysis of the linearised theory expression for the
zero-lift wave drag of a smooth, slender body in terms of its
cross-sectional area distribution is used
to derive the area distribution which
minimises the expression for given
length, volume, nose area, base area
and n intermediate areas .  another
minimal deduced from this by relaxing
the restriction on volume is used to
evolve a method for the numerical
evaluation of the original expression .
  two practical applications of these
results are discussed .  the first
is in the design of wing-body combinations
to have small drag rise at
transonic speeds .  the second is in the
calculation of the wave drag of
wing-body combinations at zero lift,.
an example is constructed to
illustrate the method and to give an indication of its accuracy .
