An Efficient Design for Chemical Structure Searching. I. The Screens
   A method has been developed for generating efficient screens for chemical
structures.. Fragments are generated by an algorithm under control of file
statistics.. The fragments obtained are normalized by weighting their code
patterns.. Superimposition of these codes yields the screen codes for the
structures..
