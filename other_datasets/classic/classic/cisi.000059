Opinion Paper
   Although a large number of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) 
Systems have been planned, implemented, and tested over the past few years, 
insufficient attention has been given to the collection and interpretation of 
important data needed for evaluation.. We describe some of the defects common 
to almost all of the reported systems, single out one recent report for 
detailed discussion and argue in favor of collection and correct interpretation 
of data on one important and frequently overlooked evaluation factor..
