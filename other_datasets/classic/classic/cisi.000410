Handbook of Medical Library Practice
  The Medical Library Association has long been aware of the need for a
third edition of the Handbook.  Changes in library practices, proliferating
demands upon established libraries, and the development of new ones
created the need of an up-to-date tool.  Like the earlier editions,
this Handbook is such a tool, a manual, not a survey of the state of the
art.  It offers practical advice to all - fledgling librarians starting
their careers, experienced librarians transferring to the field of
health sciences, established medical librarians refreshing memories or
adopting procedures unfamiliar to them, and specialists in related fields.
