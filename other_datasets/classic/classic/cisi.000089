Professional Standing and the Reception of Scientific Discoveries
  The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists receive differential recognition
for a particular scientific contribution depending on their
location in the stratification system.  Merton originally introduced
the concept to explain the allocation of credit among authors of
multiple discoveries or collaborators.  In this paper the concept is
generalized to apply to all scientific work.  If the Matthew Effect
were to operate, the reception of papers of equal quality should be
influenced by the location of their authors in the stratification system.
To test this hypothesis, data are drawn from several studies of
similar design.  In each study we control for the number of citations
papers received at time 2.  This enables us to look at groups of
papers that were judged to be roughly equal in quality at time 2.
We then see whether there were any differences in the reception of
these papers at time 1 depending upon various aspects of the author's
location in the stratification system.  All the data indicate
that assessed quality of papers at time 2 is a more important 
determinant of a paper's initial reception than any of the stratification
variables.  However, the speed of diffusion of papers of equal quality
is influenced by the reputation of the author based on past work
that is being heavily utilized at the time of a new discovery.  The
Matthew Effect also operates for those scientists located at prestigious
points of the social system of science.  All other stratification
variables, including eminence as measured by receipt of awards
did not influence the speed of diffusion.  Data are presented that
indicate that top papers written by high-ranking scientists are no 
more likely to be widely diffused early than are top papers by low-
ranking scientists.  The Matthew Effect also serves to focus
attention on the work of little-known men who collaborate with
scientists of high repute and to increase retroactively the visibility
of the early work of scientists who go on to greater fame.  A discussion
is included of the relevance of these data for the study of
resistance to scientific discoveries.
