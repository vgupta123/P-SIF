  tsien in a recent paper (j. math. phys. mass. inst. tech.
sonic flows around slender bodies and has pointed out that
the product of mach number and fineness ratio is a basic
similarity parameter .  the author enlarges on this notion,
indicating that the problem of hypersonic flow about a
slender body in three dimensions is the same as that of a
certain two-dimensional nonsteady flow (with time replacing
the lengthwise spatial coordinate) characterized by
essentially the same similarity parameter .
