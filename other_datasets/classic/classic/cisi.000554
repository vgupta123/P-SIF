Introduction to Information Science
  The main emphasis of this book is on work of a theoretical
and experimental nature rather than on practical
applications.  However, the articles selected are viewed
as having a considerable potential in two major respects:
they have important implications for the practice of
information handling, but even more important, they contain
aspects of generalization.  The book is oriented
toward basic and experimental work, such as that
performed by traditional sciences, with the hope that a
reader may find much relevant to his own interests,
educational level and background, a bridge toward
generalizations, a feeling of interconnection between
seemingly unrelated works either presented in the book or
found in the literature, an awareness of apparent gaps in
knowledge, and even ideas for practical solutions or
further theoretical or experimental work.
