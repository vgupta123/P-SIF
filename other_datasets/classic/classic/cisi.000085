Information Science: Toward the Development of a True Scientific Discipline
   It is pointed out that if information science is to be considered a "true" 
science similar to physics or chemistry then it must have a set of concepts and
analytical expression which apply to the flow of information in a general way..
In several previous papers, the author and a colleague have described a model 
of a generalized information system which has  wide, and perhaps universal 
applicability.. This paper elaborates on this model and indicates the range of 
its applicability.. Several fundamental quantities are defined specifically in 
a way which allows for quantification.. It is pointed out in this paper that 
this model can be the basis for the development of a "true" science of 
information with all of the necessary requirements for a science.. By the use 
of this model and the definition of a "true" science, the goals and requirements 
for a curriculum in information science are thus established.. Within this 
context, information is defined as data of value in decision making.. 
Quantitative measures of information can be obtained by relating information to 
specific observable actions which can be measured physically..
