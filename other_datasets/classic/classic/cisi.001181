The Origins of the Information Crisis:  A Contribution to the Statement 
of the Problem
   The different explanations of the nature of the information problems now
facing science and their causes are cited and shown to be debatable.. It is
necessary to give a definition of "information crisis", this widely used 
concept in informatics and the science of science.. The author suggests one
such definition, which reflects the specific historical nature of the possible
manifestations of the crisis.. The "cumulativistic" concept of the progress of
science is criticized as it rules out the possibility of finding the true
causes of the information crisis.. The major cause is asserted to lie with the
nature of the contemporary social production.. An approach to studying into
the origins of the problem is suggested..
