Time Sharing on a Computer with a Small Memory
Techniques to make time sharing attractive on
a computer with a small central memory are presented. 
 "Small" is taken to mean that only one user program plus
a monitor will fit into the memory at any time. 
 The techniques depend on having two levels of secondary
storage: level 1, several times larger than 
the main memory and quite fast; and level 2,
many times larger and slower than level 1.
