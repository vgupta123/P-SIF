CHAMP-Character Manipulation Procedures
A new programming language facility for symbol
manipulation is described.  String procedures 
may be declared and called in a standard ALGOL context.
 ALGOL procedures can in turn be called by string 
procedures so that numeric and symbolic processes may
conveniently be programmed together.  Concatenation 
and a variant of SNOBOL's pattern matching make up
a set of primitive commands.  These are assembled 
together into conditional expressions which are to be
used to provide alternative computational patterns. 
 Arrays of strings are processed using quantifiers.
 The class of things which may be assigned to an 
identifier can be restricted by a procedure expressed
in the notation.  The language facilities have 
been implemented in the ALGOL compiler for the Burroughs B5500.
