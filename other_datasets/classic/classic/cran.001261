a method of calculating velocity distribution for turbulent
boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions .
  a new method of calculating the behavior of turbulent
boundary layers in adverse pressure distributions is developed which
permits direct determination of the velocity profile rather than
the gross integral parameters normally used to infer the general
character of the boundary layer .  the method offers the
simplicity of algebraic equations coupled with the use of charts
rather than the laborious simultaneous solution of coupled
differential equations required by existing methods .  the method also
affords, for the first time, a means of determining the total
boundary-layer thickness, thus allowing calculation of the absolute as
well as the nondimensional velocity distribution .
the velocity profile is considered to be composed of two
regions--an inner region which is described by the law of the wall
and an outer region which is described by a function depicting
the deviation from that law .  the deviation function involves
two parameters which are uniquely dependent upon the
skin-friction coefficient and a third parameter which, for practical
purposes, can be considered a constant .  since the entire
velocity distribution was found to be almost uniquely dependent
upon the local skin friction, serious doubt is cast upon the
generally accepted /history concept/ which considers the outer region
of the boundary layer to be dependent on integrated upstream
conditions .
  agreement between experimental velocity distributions and
those calculated by the method presented here is generally very
good .  the analysis and calculation procedures which are
presented are applicable to two-dimensional, pseudo-two-
dimensional, and axisymmetric conical flows .
