The Concept of Main Entry as Represented in the Anglo-American Cataloging Rules
  The work published here is rather like those conclusive statements
of renaissance science that located the soul not in the human frame but
in the human spirit.  The author of this work may face the wrath of the
medievalists among our fellow professional catalogers.  At the least, the
publication of this book should encourage a complete reappraisal of our
cataloging methods, because the difference between title unit entry and
author-equivalent unit entry, a confabulation of main and unit entry
arising from tradition rather than practicality, can be clearly seen not 
only in the job classifications and job descriptions of cataloging
departments, but also in our philosophy of librarianship.
