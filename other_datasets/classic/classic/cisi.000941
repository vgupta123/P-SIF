ISBD Standard or Secret?
  The controversial ISBD will mean radical changes in descriptive cataloging
practice if put into operation, as planned, by the Library of Congress.
Users of LC catalog cards will require retraining: all reference librarians 
will experience an immediate and continuing demand for explanation of the 
new catalog cards to users; those large public and research libraries with 
computer-based systems will require costly modifications of computer programs.
Yet the ISBD (International Standard Bibliographic Description) is destined 
to be implemented by the Library of Congress with the sanction of ALA but 
without even being considered by the recognized standards associations (ISO, 
ANSI), to say nothing of the other professional and information industry 
organizations.
