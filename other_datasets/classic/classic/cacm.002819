Experiments in Text File Compression
A system for the compression of data files,
viewed as strings of characters, is presented. 
 The method is general, and applies equally well to
English, to PL/I, or to digital data.  The system 
consists of an encoder, an analysis program, and a decoder.
  Two algorithms for encoding a string differ 
slightly from earlier proposals.  The analysis program attempts
to find an optimal set of codes for representing 
substrings of the file.  Four new algorithms for this
operation are described and compared.  Various 
parameters in the algorithms are optimized to obtain
a high degree of compression for sample texts.
