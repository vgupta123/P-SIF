Concept Organization for Information Retrieval
  All analysis of information for storage and of questions for effecting
retrieval must be in terms of concepts and the relations between them.
The concepts may be just words (descriptors), as in simple post-co-ordinate
keyword indexing systems, or they may be class-terms or other idea-groupings,
as in classifications.  The relations between concepts often appear to be
absent, but if more than one word is used in indexing or in a search there is
clearly an implicit relation between them in the mind of the indexer or
questioner, and other relations possible between the words would lead to
false drops.  Classification has traditionally been a method of organization
of concepts in which the relations between concepts are ostensibly displayed
in the form of groupings called classes.
