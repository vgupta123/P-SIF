the effect of growth hormone
on kidney transamidinase in the
hypophysectomized mouse
the role of growth hormone and certain other endocrine factors in re-
gulating kidney transamidinase has been investigated in the mouse.  the
kidney transamidinase values are low following hypophysectomy.  growth
hormone administration in doses of 0.5 to 5.0 ug/day (ovine nih) restore
the enzyme activity towards normal.  a bioassay for growth hormone is
suggested based on the determination of the total kidney transamidinase.
intact mice that had been given relatively large doses of triiodothyronin
had low enzyme activities.  enzyme values in alloxan-treated mice were
normal.
