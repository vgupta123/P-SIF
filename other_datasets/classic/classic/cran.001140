shock-standoff distance for spherical bodies at high
mach numbers .
  usaf-sponsored development of a simple expression for
shock-standoff distance, by consideration of an apropriate specific-heat
ratio behind the shock .  the theory gives predictions which are
almost as accurate as those of the van dyke and hays methods .
