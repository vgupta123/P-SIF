Computer Use in Information and Data Handling: 
  an Appraisal of Its Economic Aspects
   The economic merits of applying computers in information storage, retrieval 
and dissemination have usually been considered with respect only to the cost of 
operating the information services concerned.. This had tended to indicate that
computer use is economically justified mainly for housekeeping operations in 
the large scale organizations..
   The present paper takes a wider view and included in its appraisal the costs
involved in information gathering and dissemination for the total system 
representing the information services and its users.. It is suggested that the 
inclusion of cost elements associated with user time devoted to information 
gathering tends to shift the economic appraisal in favor of computer application
in information work..
   In fact, such computer use appears to find its main stimulus and economic 
justification    in an environment that provides strong incentives to minimize 
the total cost of the system whilst maximizing its benefits to the users..
   To illustrate this some example are given based on experience gained in 
research data handling and the operation of SDI services in an industrial 
research establishment..
