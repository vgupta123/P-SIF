a note on havelock's shallow-water wave-resistance
curves .
in the continuous quest for improved means of
transportation, attention is currently focused on the ground-effect
machine .  as there is no physical contact between the vehicle
and the terrain over which it operates, its performance should
be similar over land and water .  however, over water there is
an additional resistance to motion due to the gravity-wave
system generated by the supporting or /cushion/ pressure acting
on the water surface .  estimates of this component can be made
using the analysis of t. h. havelock .  it is the purpose of this
note to present an ibm 650 digital-computer solution of his
equations .  as shown below, these results differ from havelock's
original results .
