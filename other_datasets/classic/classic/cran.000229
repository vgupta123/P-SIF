cruciform tail set at both incidence and yaw .
  the interference between the wings and the tail surfaces of a
combination of circular body, low aspect ratio cruciform wings and
cruciform tail in an inviscid flow is analysed using the slender body
theory .  the system may be subjected to both incidence and yaw and,
in general, the tail fins may be staggered angularly with respect to
the main wings .
  the method is a development of that used by owen and maskell in
r.a.e. report no. aero.2441 to analyse similar effects on a system set
at zero yaw .
  simple expressions to determine the strengths and positions of
the trailing vortices (supposed to be rolled-up) downstream of the main
wings are given, and from them the forces on the tail are deduced .
when the tail surfaces are triangular and of low aspect ratio an exact
solution is obtained from slender body theory ..  but for rectangular
tail surfaces of moderate or high aspect ratio, it is suggested that the
changes in lift and sideforce on the tail caused by the wing vortex
field can be estimated approximately from the mean upwash and sidewash
angles evaluated over the respective tail spans .  formulae for these
means angles are presented .
