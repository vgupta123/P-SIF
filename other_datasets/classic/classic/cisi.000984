Cost Analysis Studies in Libraries: Is There a Basis for Comparison?
  When the Chairman of the Technical Services Cost Committee asked
the three of us to summarize the findings of the Colorado study on
centralized processing, I agreed.  Later, I began to have second 
thoughts - I suppose because we were almost buried under an 
avalanche of data and it soon became apparent that we could not
really summarize the findings of the study in one evening.
  The investigation took off in tangents that had not been originally
anticipated.  As you have already been informed, the final report deals
with such diverse topics as a faculty user attitude survey, mathematical
model simulations of processing center operations, approval plan
utilization, and an inter-institutional bookkeeping system, all in
addition to the cost studies of acquisitions and cataloging in nine
libraries.
