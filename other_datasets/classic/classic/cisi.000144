The Art of Computer Programming
  The process of preparing programs for a digital computer is especially
attractive because it not only can be economically and scientifically
rewarding, it can also be an aesthetic experience much like composing
poetry or music.  This book is the first volume of a seven-volume set
of books that has been designed to train the reader in the various skills
which go into a programmer's craft.
