A Comparative Study of Computer Programs
for Integrating Differential Equations
A study comparing the performance of several computer
programs for integrating systems of ordinary 
differential equations is reported.  The integration methods represented
include multistep methods (predictor-correctors), 
single-step methods (Runge-Kutta) and extrapolation methods
(both polynomial and rational).  The testing 
procedure is described together with the evaluation
criteria applied.  A set of test problems on which 
the programs were tested is included in an appendix.
 For the particular problems and criteria used in 
the investigation it was found that a program based on
rational extrapolation showed the best performance.
