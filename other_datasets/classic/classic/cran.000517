reaction-resisted shock fronts .
  it is shown that shock waves whose
structure is determined solely by the effects
of chemical reactions (reaction-resisted
shock fronts) are possible and completely
analogous to relaxation - resisted waves .
a single dissociation reaction is considered
and numerical results indicate that such
waves could be observed experimentally .
bulk viscosities equivalent to reaction
effects are possibly 10 or more times shear
viscosity values .  (examples are based on
lighthill's ideal dissociating gas) .
