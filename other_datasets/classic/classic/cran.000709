static longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at transonic speeds and
angles of attack up to 99degree of a reentry glider having folding
wingtip panels .
data are presented which were obtained from a transonic wind-tunnel
investigation of a reentry glider having folding wing-tip panels . the
tests were conducted at angles of attack from -4degrees to 99degrees .
the reynolds number based on the mean geometric chord of the fixed
planform varied from 2.35 x 10 to 2.99 x 10 .
the maximum lift-drag ratio for the model with the folding wing-tip
panels fully extended decreased from a maximum value of 7.8 at a mach
number of 0.60 to about 3.4 at mach numbers from 1.03 to 1.20 . the
model with the folding wing panels fully extended was stable for values
of the lift coefficient from 0 up to at least 0.8 . above this lift
coefficient pitch-up tendencies were observed, followed by an unstable or
neutrally stable region which extended up to values of angle of attack
of 50degrees or 60degrees . deflecting the folding wing panels between
ducing a significant change in the trim angle of attack or in any of the
 force or moment coefficients in the angle-of-attack range from 49degree
to 99degree .
