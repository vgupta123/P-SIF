Reasoning About Arrays
A variety of concepts, laws, and notations are presented which facilitate
reasoning about arrays.  The basic concepts include intervals and their
partitions, functional restriction, images, pointwise extension of relations,
ordering, single-point variation of functions, various equivalence relations 
for array values, and concatenation.  The effectiveness
of these ideas is illustrated by informal descriptions of
algorithms for binary search and merging, and by a short formal proof.
