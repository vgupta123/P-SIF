Libraries and Cultural Change
  This work is a contribution to the literature of librarianship and
some parts of it may interest a wider audience.  The chapters consist
of a series of introductory explorations into several related fields.
Some of these areas are usually included in curricula for library
studies programmes, under a title such as "The library and the
community" or "The social background to libraries."
