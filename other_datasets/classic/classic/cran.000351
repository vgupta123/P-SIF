thermal distributions in jeffrey-hamel flows between nonparallel plane
walls .
the authors give the exact solution for the thermal distributions for
the steady laminar flow of a viscous incompressible fluid between
non-parallel plane walls held at a constant temperature . the velocity
profiles are determined with the aid of jacobian elliptic functions by
using the jeffery-hamel solution of the hydrodynamic problem . it is
shown that in this special case the energy equation giving the
temperature profiles can be reduced to an ordinary linear differential
equation with variable coefficients . after the introduction of
dimensionless parameters, numerical solutions are given for diverging and
converging channels with total openings of 10degree for the possible
combinations of three reynolds numbers and five prandtl numbers .
