oscillating airfoils at high mach number .
a simple formula is given for the pressure distribution on an
oscillating airfoil in two-dimensional flow at high mach number . the
formula is expected to be reasonably accurate if the pressure on the
surface remains within the range 0.2 to 3.5 times the mainstream
pressure . to illustrate the application of the formula, some results
for symmetrical airfoils performing pitching oscillations are obtained
and compared with results obtained from existing theories in the case of
 high mach number .
