subsonic aerodynamic flutter derivatives for wings and control surfaces,
 /compressible and incompressible flow/ .
this report gives tables of the two-dimensional subsonic flutter
derivatives,. where possible the values given are based on the published
 work of various authors, but some have been specially calculated for
this report . wing derivatives are given for mach numbers 0, 0.5, 0.6
and 0.7 for the frequency parameter range 0 /0.04/ 0.2 /0.2/ 1.6 and
mach numbers 0 and 0.7 for frequency parameter 5.0 . control surface
derivatives are given for mach numbers 0 and 0.7 for control surface/
wing chord ratios 0.02 /0.02/ 0.10 /0.05/ 0.50 and frequency parameters
are also given for mach numbers 0, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 for frequency
parameter 0 /0.04/ 0.2 /0.2/ 1.4 . control surface-tab derivatives are
given for some particular values of the variables and methods of
obtaining approximate values of these derivatives for other values of
the variables are suggested . control surface and tab derivatives are in
 all cases for no aerodynamic balance .
