effects of alkalosis on plasma concentration and urinary
excretion of inorganic phosphate in man
acute respiratory and metabolic alkalosis have
been shown to depress plasma phosphorus con-
centration in normal man.  the fall in plasma
phosphorus concentration is greater in respiratory
than in comparable levels of extracellular meta-
bolic alkalosis.  this fall is not attributable to in-
creased renal excretion or to migration into red
blood cells.  the evaluation of low serum phos-
phorus concentrations should always be carried
out with a knowledge of the ph and total co2
content of the plasma.
