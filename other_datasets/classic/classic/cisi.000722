Information Transfer Limitations of Titles of Chemical Documents
  Some methods of estimating the minimum amounts of information in a document
not retrievable through its title are discussed.  An analysis of the information
transferred by different types of keywords is helpful in planning search
strategies, e.g., 30% of chemical substances mentioned in journal articles
are not discernable in their titles even when broad class names are used
as synonyms.  Patents have considerably less informative titles than journal
articles.  In nuclear science, report titles are also less informative than 
those of journal articles, but the proportion of reports with completely 
uninformative titles is now only 10% of the 1957 value.  Titles in chemistry
are more informative than those in most other fields, but the use of alerting
and other services based on titles requires a good understanding of the
underlying information transfer principles.
