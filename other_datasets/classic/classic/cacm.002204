Program Development by Stepwise Refinement
The creative activity of programming-to be distinguished
from coding-is usually taught by examples 
serving to exhibit certain techniques.  It is here considered
as a sequence of design decisions concerning 
the decomposition of tasks into subtasks and of data
into data structures.  The process of successive 
refinement of specifications is illustrated by a short
but nontrivial example, from which a number of 
conclusions are drawn regarding the art and the instruction of programming.
