transformation of the compressible turbulent boundary
layer .
  the transformation of the compressible turbulent boundary-
layer equations to their incompressible equivalent is
demonstrated analytically .  the transformation is essentially the same
as that for the laminar layer, first given by stewartson, except
that the explicit relation between the viscosity and temperature
is not required .  a key point in the analysis is the modification
of the stream function to include a mean of the fluctuating
components and the postulate that the apparent turbulent shear,
associated with an elemental mass, remains invariant in the
transformation .
  the values of the incompressible friction coefficients and of
pressure rise causing separation thus transformed show good
agreement with the experimentally measured and independently
reported results .  an application of the transformation to the
self-preserving boundary layers and to the computations of
general boundary-layer flow is shown .
