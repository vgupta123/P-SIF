Attribute Based File Organization in a Paged Memory Environment
The high cost of page accessing implies a need
for more careful data organization in a paged 
memory than is typical of most inverted file and similar
approaches to multi-key retrieval.  This article 
analyses that cost and proposes a method called multiple
key hashing which attempts to minimize it.  
Since this approach is not always preferable to inversion,
a combined method is described.  The exact 
specifications of this combination for a file with given
data and traffic characteristics is formulated 
as a mathematical program.  The proposed heuristic solution
to this program can often improve on a simple 
inversion technique by a factor of 2 or 3.
