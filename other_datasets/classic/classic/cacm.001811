A Case Study in Programming for Parallel-Processors
An affirmative partial answer is provided to
the question of whether it is possible to program 
parallel-processor computing systems to efficiently decrease
execution time for useful problems.  Parallel-processor 
systems are multiprocessor systems in which several of
the processors can simultaneously execute separate 
tasks of a single job, thus cooperating to decrease
the solution time of a computational problem. The 
processors have independent instruction counters, meaning
that each processor executes its own task program 
relatively independently of the other processors.  Communication
between cooperating processors is by 
means of data in storage shared by all processors.  A
program for the determination of the distribution 
of current in an electrical network was written for a
parallel-processor computing system, and execution 
of this program was simulated.  The data gathered from
simulation runs demonstrate the efficient solution 
of this problem, typical of a large class of important
problems.  It is shown that, with proper programming, 
solution time when N processors are applied approaches
1/N times the solution time for a single processor, 
while improper programming can actually lead to an increase
of solution time with the number of processors. 
 Stability of the method of solution was also investigated.
