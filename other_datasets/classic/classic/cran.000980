a method of computing the transient temperature of thick walls from
arbitrary variation of adiabatic-wall temperature and heat-transfer
coefficient .
a method of calculating the temperature of thick walls has been
developed in which are used relatively new concepts, such as the time
series and the response to a unit triangle variation of surface
temperature, together with essentially standard formulas for transient
temperature and heat flow into thick walls . the method can be used
without knowledge of the mathematical tools of its development . the
method is particularly suitable for determining the wall temperature in
one-dimensional thermal problems in aeronautics where there is a
continuous variation of the heat-transfer coefficient and adiabatic-wall
temperature . the method also offers a convenient means for solving the
inverse problem of determining the heat-flow history when temperature
history is known .
a series of diversified problems were solved by exact analysis as well
as by the new method . a comparison of the results shows the new
method to be accurate . the labor involved is very modest in
consideration of the nature of the thick-wall temperature problem .
limiting solutions for the /infinitely thick/ wall and for walls so
thin that thermal lag can be neglected were also obtained .
