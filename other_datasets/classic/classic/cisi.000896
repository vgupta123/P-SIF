Job Dimensions and Educational Needs in Librarianship
  This study was undertaken to meet more fully the demands for
improved and expanded training of library personnel, especially at the
middle and upper levels, occasioned by the rapidly changing roles and
functions of libraries as they try to adapt to the vast social, economic,
and technological changes currently in progress.  The rise to a higher
level of required skills and competencies - often new - has brought about
an urgent need for improved training beyond the first professional
degree at the post-master's level.  The basic purpose of this research is
curriculum development at the post-master's level that will equip the
middle- and upper-level personnel in libraries for the changes confronting
them.  Although it would be possible to restructure the master's program
and add the courses that this study shows a need for, that alternative
has not been pursued for two reasons: a fairly stable master's curriculum
is widely accepted and institutionalized and, more important, the new
courses are designed for a different group of students - experienced
librarians.
