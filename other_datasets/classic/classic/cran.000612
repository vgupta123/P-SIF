pressure distributions and flow patterns at m=4 . on
some delta wings of inverted 'v' cross section .
  wind tunnel tests have been made
to measure pressure distributions
and to study flow patterns on a series
of delta wings of inverted 'v'
cross-section .  each of these wings
was designed to have a plane shock
wave in the plane of the leading edges
at a chosen mach number and incidence .
  it was found that for a wide
incidence range about the design point
the shock wave remained virtually
attached to the leading edges and at
each incidence the pressure was
approximately constant over the lower
surface .
