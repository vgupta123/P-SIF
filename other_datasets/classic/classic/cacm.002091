PDEL-A Language for Partial Differential Equations
Conventional computer methods available to solve
continuous system problems characterized by partial
differential equations are very time-consuming and cumbersome.  A
convenient, easy to learn and to use, high level problem oriented
language to solve and study partial differential equation problems
has been designed; a practical translator for the language has also
been designed, and a working version of it has been constructed
for a significant portion of the language.  This Partial Differential
Equation Language, PDEL, is outlined, and the highlights
of the translator are briefly summarized.
