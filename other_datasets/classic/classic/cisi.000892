The Georgia Tech Library's Microfiche Catalog
   The Price Gilbert Memorial Library of the Georgia Institute of Technology has 
reproduced its entire card catalog on microfiche, and is updating this basic 
file with a bimonthly cumulated supplement produced by the Computer Output
Microfiche (COM) process.. The total catalog has been placed, with in 
appropriate microfiche reader, in every academic and research department on
campus - thereby taking the chief bibliographic record of the library to the 
faculty user.. Remote bibliographic access is complemented by a telephone 
request and delivery service which provides delivery of requested books or
photocopies from the library to the faculty member..
