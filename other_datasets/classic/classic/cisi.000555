Introduction to Library Science:
Basic Elements of Library Service
    Librarianship classifies as a social science because the library, as an
institution, is a creature of society, and its goal is the improvement of
society by helping the individual to understand himself and the world of
which he is a part.  But the library is also concerned with man as a 
rational being.  Thus, it remains primarily a humanistic enterprise.  The
traditional lines of demarcation among the disciplines are breaking down
and in certain areas becoming almost obliterated; and librarianship, in
both its technology and its services, is drawing ever closer to the social
and physical sciences.  But we would do well to remind ourselves of the 
library's humanistic origins; otherwise, in excessive enthusiasm for the
technology of science and the social action of the behaviorist, we may lose
sight of the individual and his needs and the humanistic values implicit
in them.
