Expected Search Length: A Single Measure of Retrieval Effectiveness
 Based on the Work Ordering Action of Retrieval Systems
   A measure of document retrieval system performance called the "expected 
search length reduction factor" is defined and compared with indicators, such 
as precision and recall, that have been suggested by other workers.. The new 
measure is based on calculations of the expected number of irrelevant documents
in the collection which would have to be searched through before the desired 
number of relevant documents could be found.. Its advantages are: (1) it 
provides  a single index of the property it attempts to measure; (2) it allows
for gradations of retrieval status, through the mathematical concept of a "weak 
ordering"; (3) it evaluates retrieval performance relative to random searching;
and (4) it takes into account the amount of relevant material desired by the 
requester..
