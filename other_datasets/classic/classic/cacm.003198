   Microprogramming, Emulators and Programming Languages
  The problem we have been concerned with is that of converting language to
action - or intellectual energy to mechanical energy. The medium that we use 
for this purpose is language and therefore we are preoccupied with the subject
of language. In the areas of language investigation we have concentrated first 
on formalizing syntax and then on semantics.
