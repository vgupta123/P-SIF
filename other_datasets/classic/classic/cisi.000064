A Computer-Based Serials Control System for a Large Biomedical Library
   Rather than reiterate the obvious purposes and procedures involved in 
creating a computer system for control of serials, in this paper the author
deals with the concept upon which the UCLA system is based and the manner in
which the system is maintained in day-to-day operations of the UCLA Biomedical
Library.. The paper deals with some of the points made in an earlier publication
from the UCLA serials project.. The attempt is to show how the theory of 
publication pattern (discussed in the earlier article) has been used to 
produce a different idea in computer control of serials.. Publication pattern 
information which is entered into the master record for each title causes
check-in cards for the next expected issue of each title to be generated by the
computer, regardless of when this text issue is expected - next week, next
month, next year.. This is departure from most systems, which attempt to 
predict a certain number of issues which should arrive during a given time 
period.. The information, which must be a part of the computer record, is 
described, as are library procedures in maintaining the system..
