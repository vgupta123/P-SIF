recovery of a pleuropneumonia-like organism
(p.p.l.o.) from the genitalia of the female
albino rat
the genital organs of seventy-seven nonproductive breeder female rats
were examined grossly and histologically and bacteriological cultures of the
uterus and ovaries were made.  three of the seventy-seven animals showed a
purulent salpingitis and oophoritis.  a pleuropneumonia-like organism was
isolated from the uterus and ovaries of 29% of the animals examined.  the
cultures obtained from the genitalia were compared with the p.p.l.o. isolated
from the middle ears of some of these same animals and the two appeared to be
identical.  intraperitoneal injection of the p.p.l.o. cultures into young
rats and mice produced oophoritis and salpingitis in the mice but not in the
rats.
