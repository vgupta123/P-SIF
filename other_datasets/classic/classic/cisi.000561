A Dynamic Programming Approach to R and D Budgeting and Project Selection
   Contemporary models of research and development are incomplete in that they
ignore the many reappraisals and budgeting decisions that occur in the time
between a project's proposal and its commercialization.. The sequential 
decision aspects of project budgeting are particularly important since 1) the
research expenditure is usually an order of magnitude less than the irrevocable
investment for commercialization and 2) an allocation to a project today does 
not presuppose continuation of the project into future periods..
   The research and development budgeting problem is structured to take into 
account the sequential decision characteristic.. Utilizing the technique of
dynamic programming, methods are developed to determine optimal project budgets
when the aggregate research and development budget is either constrained or
unconstrained.. These models also suggest a rational explanation of the 
patterns of project expenditures over time that one observes in practice..
   Finally, some of the shortcomings of the developed methods which inhibit
their practical application are discussed..
