Automatic Classification and Retrieval of Documents by Means 
  of a Bibliographic Pattern Discovery Algorithm
   We present completely automatic procedures for the self-generation of 
meaningful groups among the members of a document collection and for the 
classification according to these groups of subsequent documents.. These
procedures operate on large document collections with reasonably short
computation times.. Thus far, in our experiments on the physics literature,
automatic classification has proven to be as good as or better than manual
indexing and, in addition, potentially less expensive.. Empirically derived, 
our method is based upon a pattern discovery algorithm which use only the 
citation content of a document and with operates on the bibliographic links 
among papers.. The self-generated groups correspond to very specific subject 
headings; retrospective bibliographies generated in the procedures allow one 
to classify the subsequent literature with remarkably high recall and 
relevance ratios, close to 100%..
