Scanned-Display Computer Graphics
A television-like scanned-display system has
been successfully implemented on a Honeywell DDP-224 
computer installation.  The scanned image is stored
in the core memory of the computer, and software 
scan conversion is used to convert the rectangular coordinates
of a point to the appropriate word and 
bit in an output display array in core storage.  Results
thus far indicate that flicker-free displays 
of large amounts of data are possible with reasonably
fast graphical interaction.  A scanned image of 
size 240 X 254 points is displayed at a 30 frame-per-second rate.
