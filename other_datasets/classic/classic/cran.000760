inelastic buckling of initially imperfect cylindrical
shells subject to axial compression .
  an analytical and experimental study is made for inelastic
instability of initially imperfect cylindrical shells subject to
axial compression .  donnell's equations and the principle of
virtual work are adapted to determine the effects of initial
imperfections on the buckling modes and the critical buckling
stresses .  the deformation theory and the incremental theory
of plastic stress-strain relationships are both considered .  the
experimental results of ten tests on specimens made of aluminum
alloy 3003-0 are presented .  comparison of experimental with
theoretical results indicates that the application of the
deformation theory provides a fairly accurate prediction of buckling
strength, but fails in this case to yield a correct description of
post-buckling behavior .  on the other hand, the application of
the incremental theory, which is mathematically and physically
more rigorous, leads to an overestimation of buckling strength,
even though initial imperfections are considered .  this paradox
has existed for years, and remains to be resolved .
