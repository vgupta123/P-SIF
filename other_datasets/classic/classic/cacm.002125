A Note on Minimal Length Polygonal Approximation to a Digitized Contour
A method for extracting a smooth polygonal
contour from a digitized image is illustrated.
The ordered sequence of contour points and the connection graph of
the image are first obtained by a modified Ledley algorithm in one
image scan.  A minimal perimeter polygon subjected to specified constraints
is then chosen as the approximating contour.  The determination of the minimal 
polygon can be reduced to a nonlinear programming
problem, solved by an algorithm which takes into account
the weak bonds between variables.  Some examples are presented,
and the corresponding computing times are listed.
