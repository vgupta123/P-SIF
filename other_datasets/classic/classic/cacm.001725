A Simple Proof of Lewin's Ordered-Retrieval
Theorem for Associative Memories
An efficient method of ordered retrieval of binary
words from an associative memory, as described
by Lewin, is based on the use of special readout circuits
which indicate the digit values present in 
the individual digit columns of the memory.  Thus the
circuits indicate whether the individual digit 
columns contain digits of both values, or of only one
value, or contain no digits at all (i.e. that the 
memory is empty).  The use of these circuits, which
in this paper are termed column value indicators, 
reduces considerably the number of memory accesses necessary
to retrieve in order a number of distinct 
words from the memory.  Lewin proves that, for the readout
by the described method of m distinct binary 
words, 2m - 1 memory accesses are necessary.  (Thus he
proves that the number of necessary memory accesses 
of his method, unlike those of other methods, is independent
of the word length.)  In this paper a very 
simple proof of this theorem derived from some elementary
aspects of the structure of sets of binary 
numbers is presented.
