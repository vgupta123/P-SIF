Diffusion of Abstract and Indexing Services for Government - Sponsored Research
  During the last several decades, science and technology have
undergone a drastic transformation.  The enormity and depth of this
transformation can be measured in many ways.  It can be measured
in terms of the number of students enrolled in graduate and
undergraduate schools offering degrees in the physical and applied
sciences, in terms of the number of new devices, products and
innovations introduced into the military establishment and into the 
civilian sector of our economy, in terms of the number of scientists and
engineers employed by industry and public and private institutions,
in terms of the amounts of money expended annually on research
and development, in terms of the number of technical reports, books,
journals, papers, reprints, and conference proceedings stemming
from these expenditures, and in many other ways.
