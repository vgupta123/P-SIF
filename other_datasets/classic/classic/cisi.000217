User Services Offered By Medical School Libraries in 1968:
Results of a National Survey Employing New Methodology
   The breadth and depth of services that ninety-two medical school libraries
offer to individual user were ascertained by interviewing the heads of these
libraries, employing a standardized inventory procedure developed earlier
(Bulletin 56:380-403, Oct.1968).. Selected aspects of the descriptive data 
obtained on services to faculty and to medical students are presented and 
commented upon.. Comparisons with the findings of earlies surveys suggest 
that increases in the stuffs and budgets of medical school libraries over the 
past two decades have gone largely to supporting a rapidly increasing volume of 
service, rather than to any striking increase in the breadth and depth of
services.. To facilitate summarization and comparisons among libraries the 
descriptive data were weighted and converted to quantitative measures; the
weighting scheme was established by a group of five academic medical librarians
to reflect the relative values the group assigned to different services..
One these quantitative measures, the percentage score for overall services
relative to the optimal library, summarizes a library,s services in a single
figure.. On this measure, medical school libraries ranged from 38 percent to 
87 percent; the median overall score was 63 percent.. Results of some 
exploratory analysis are described; these analyses attempted ti find 
explanations for the observed differences among libraries and among geographical
regions on the quantitative measures.. Present and potential uses of the survey
data for managerial and research purposes are discussed.. One of the most
important of these uses is in establishing and implementing standards - 
activities which should be carried out by the library profession itself - and
recommendations are made for a program of such activities that is appropriate 
for the Medical Library Association..
