genetic pituitary dwarfism with high serum concentration of growth
hormone new inborn error of metabolism?.
   a description is given of three siblings with hypoglycemia
and other clinical and laboratory signs of growth
hormone deficiency but with abnormally high concentrations
of immunoreactive serum growth hormone.  since
exogenous growth hormone was active in these patients,
the endogenous secretion of an abnormal growth hormone
molecule is postulated.
