A Cell Organized Raster Display for Line Drawings
Raster scan computer graphics displays with
"real time" character generators have previously 
been limited to alphanumeric characters.  A display is
described which extends the capabilities of this 
organization to include general graphics.  The feasibility
of such a display is shown by deriving the 
minimum number of patterns required in the read only
memory of the character generator to synthesize 
an arbitrary line.  The synthesis process does not compromise
picture quality since the resulting dot 
patterns are identical with those of a conventional
raster display.  Furthermore, the time constraints 
of a raster display are shown to be satisfied for
a typical design for very complex line drawings.
