formal speech characteristics as a diagnostic aid in childhood
psychosis.
the frequency of use of various grammatical
units in the spontaneous conversational
speech of adults and children has been
noted by many authors to be fairly stable.
the hypothesis that idiosyncratic distributions
might be found in certain specific
disorders of ego functioning was tested
in relationship to childhood psychosis.  some
support was found for this, as well as
for some contemporary psychological and
psychoanalytical interpretations of phenomena
seen in childhood psychosis.
