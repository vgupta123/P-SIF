compressibility effects in magneto-aerodynamic flows
past thin bodies .
  the effects of compressibility on the steady motion of a highly
conducting fluid past thin cylindrical bodies in the presence of a
magnetic field are studied .  procedures are developed for the
solution of this class of magnetoaerodynamic problems over the
entire mach number range and for all ratios of magnetic to
fluid-dynamic pressure .  the results obtained are analogous either to
the ackeret theory or the prandtl-glauert rule of conventional
aerodynamics, depending on the relative values of the flow speed
and the appropriate speed of propagation of magnetoacoustic
disturbances .  the methods used and the physical interpretation
of the solutions obtained vary according to the orientation of the
magnetic field with respect to the flow direction .
  the results of the theory are explained in terms of the
anisotropic propagation of magnetoacoustic pulses studied previously
by several authors .
