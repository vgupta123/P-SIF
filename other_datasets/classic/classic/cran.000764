breathing vibrations of a circular shell with an internal
liquid .
  resonant breathing frequencies and mode shapes are
determined experimentally for a thin-walled, circular cylindrical shell
containing a nonviscous incompressible liquid .  the resonant
frequencies determined for the full shell are in good agreement
with those predicted by reissner's shallow-shell vibration theory
with the inclusion of an apparent-mass term for the liquid .  the
effect of the internal liquid on the shell mode shapes is significant
only for the partially full shell .  in this case the circumferential
node lines tend to shift toward the bottom or filled portion of the
shell .
  excitation of low-frequency liquid-sloshing motion by
high-frequency forced oscillation of a partially filled shell occurred in
many cases .  this low-frequency liquid response is tentatively
explained as being excited by a beat frequency in the forced
oscillation .  a similar type of response has been reported by
yarymovych in axially excited rigid tanks .
