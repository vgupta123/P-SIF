An Improved Program-Synthesizing Algorithm and Its Correctness
An improved program-synthesizing algorithm
based on the algorithm proposed by Waldinger and 
Lee in 1969 is given.  In the old algorithm, the program-synthesizing
problem is translated into a theorem-proving 
problem, and a program is obtained by analyzing a proof.
 For the improved algorithm, the analysis is 
not necessary, and a program is obtained as soon as
the proof is completed.  This is achieved by using 
a modified variable tracing mechanism invented by Green
in 1969.  The correctness of the improved algorithm 
is also proved; i.e. the program thus obtained
always satisfies the specification.
