radiation necrosis of the brain in acromegaly.
radiation therapy of pituitary tumors can
cause necrosis of the brain (4 cases are reported),
particulary if a carefully considered schedule of
dosimetry is exceeded.  the error can be due to
repeated courses of treatment or too rapid administration.
the cerebral lesions develop after a
latent period of months and are progressive and
often fatal.  appropriate pituitary surgery is preferable
to multiple treatment with radiation.
