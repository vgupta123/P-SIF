iterative solutions for the non-linear bending of circular
plates .
  the authors study non-linear von karman equations
for bending of a thin circular plate under uniform normal
pressure .  discussion is mainly concerned with plates
clamped at the edges and with zero radial displacement,
but analysis is valid for other edge conditions .  solution is
by an iterative procedure whose convergence properties
are studied by means of integral equations .  method is
then applied to finite difference formulation of the
differential equations in order to obtain numerical solutions .
numerical results are compared with previous work by
other authors and the advantages of the present method
are indicated .
