The Nature of Scientific Communication and Influence
   As the formal communication system of science has become less able to
supply information with the rapidity that scientists require, increasing
attention has been paid to the structure of communication in science.. How are
scientific publications utilized by scientists? What is accomplished by the
circulation of scientific information on an informal basis? How does the social
organization among scientists facilitate or inhibit these processes?
   Three types of studies have been conducted in this area: (a) studies of the
scientific literature itself; (b) studies of how scientists obtain the 
information which they need for their research; and (c) studies of the
relationship between scientists who conduct research in the same areas.. For the
most part, studies of formal communication and information gathering have been
conducted in the absence of all but the most rudimentary theoretical models, as
has been pointed out in at least three recent reviews of these studies (Libbey
and Zaltman, 1967, p. 64; Paisley, 1968; Storer, 1968, p. 12).. The lack of
theory can be attributed partly to the practical orientation of many of the 
studies and also to the fact that an adequate model cannot be based on any one
of these types of studies alone.. A useful theory must integrate knowledge from
all three types.. In this article, we will review these studies and will 
describe a teoretical model which has been designed to fill this purpose..
