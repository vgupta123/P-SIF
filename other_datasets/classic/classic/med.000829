pour hemarthroses recentes du genou des hemophiles
a single injection of 20 ml of lyophilized fresh plasma per kg body weight is
proposed as a treatment in recent cases of knee hemarthrosis with an
important distension of the capsule, so as to achieve hemostasis, and reduce
the evolutive period.  pain is always acute and permanent in such cases of
hemarthrosis; it subsides during the plasma injection, or immediately
afterwards.
