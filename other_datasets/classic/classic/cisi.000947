Library Networks
    The combination of computers and communications technology
is a development whose time has come for libraries in the U.S.
    And despite missteps and false starts inevitable in adapting
the new technology for its use, libraries are now rapidly
expanding telecommunications networks to serve their need to
disseminate ever-expanding amounts of information in more
effective ways.
    It makes a good deal of sense when one considers that the
library's function is to parcel out information, and that
information can be forwarded electronically as easily as it can
be mailed.
    In fact, the logic of library networks is such that everyone
is hopping on the bandwagon -- consultants, systems analysts,
state agencies and a growing list of manufacturers that includes
Xerox and International Business Machines.  Their initial efforts
are concentrated on what are basically bookkeeping tasks -- in
particular, the cataloging of new acquisitions.  The Ohio college
Library Center, for example, provides its customers with entries
for their card catalog files; and because OCLC is the first and
most extensive of the networks, its approach is being closely
copied by the others.
