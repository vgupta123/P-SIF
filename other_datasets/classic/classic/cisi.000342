Corporate Headings:  Their use in library cataloguing and
national bibliographics:  A comparative and critical study 
  This study is an attempt to submit to a critical analysis the
main problems related to corporate headings, the difficulties
raised by them and the solutions which now prevail in various
countries.
  In order to make the differences existing between the various
solutions and the unsatisfactory character revealed by many of
them more evident, a great number of examples in a variety of
languages, extracted from cataloguing codes, national bibliographies, 
printed lists of corporate headings have been added.  These examples
are also intended to draw attention to differences existing with
regard to various technical details, such as punctuation, 
capitalization, transliteration, etc.
  In addition, many of these examples will clearly prove that
certain solutions which may be considered to be suitable for one
country or one language would not satisfy the requirements of
another country or another language.
  In the study, examination and analysis of codes has been 
complemented by references to professional literature on the subject
available to the author, and by an analysis of opinions expressed
there.  Special attention has been paid to comparisons of cataloguing
practices and citation usages, and to investigations of the users'
approach to corporate headings.  It is well understood and appreciated
that, for the catalogue user, the identification of and search for
corporate headings present more problems than any other type of
heading.  Unfortunately, however, professional literature has as
yet paid insufficient attention to these problems.
