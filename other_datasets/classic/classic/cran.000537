stagnation point viscous hypersonic flow .
several methods have been developed for computing the
hypersonic, low reynolds number flow in the stagnation
region of a blunt body .  in general, these methods involve
complicated numerical solutions .  simultaneous iterations on several
parameters are usually required in view of the boundary-value
nature of the problem .
  the purpose of this note is to present an approximate
closed-form solution to axisymmetric stagnation point hypersonic flow
in the viscous layer regime .
