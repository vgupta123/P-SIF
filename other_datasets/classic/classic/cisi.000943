Austerity, Technology, and Resource Sharing: Research Libraries Face the Future
  During the last two decades academic libraries, in
parallel with their parent institutions, experienced the
greatest period of growth and affluence that they have
ever known.  The watchword was "more" - more money,
more books and journals, more staff, more space, and
more technology.  Many new research libraries were
created, and those that already existed experienced
unprecedented growth.  Although libraries got more of
everything during those years, they still could not keep pace
with the growth of new fields of research, new doctoral
programs, and the increasing production of books and
journals.  Two decades of affluence not only failed to help
solve the many problems that were brought on by
exponential growth - they exacerbated them.
