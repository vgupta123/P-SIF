Scientific and Technical Libraries:
Their Organization and Administration
  The book is designed to serve multiple purposes.  First the needs of
practicing librarians, particularly those who are just beginning their
careers, and require a general guide and source of operational and
bibliographic information, have been given special consideration.  A
second purpose is to provide a textbook for library school and other
advanced students whose interests are oriented toward the literature of
the life and physical sciences.  The book could also help persons in
management positions of organizations in which the establishment of a
library is contemplated, presenting, if only from a review of the contents,
the scope of such a department.  Finally it should be a good resource for
library consultants engaged in assisting management to make the right
decisions.  The requirements of all of these audiences have been assessed
and endeavor made to meet their somewhat varied requirements.
