Detection of Logical Errors in Decision Table Programs
In this paper an algorithm to detect logical
errors in a limited-entry decision table and in 
loop-free programs with embedded decision tables is developed.
 All the conditions in the decision tables 
are assumed to be inequalities or equalities relating
linear expressions.  It is also assumed that actions 
in a decision table are linear in variables which occur
in the condition stub of the decision table (or 
tables) to which control is transferred from the table.
 The algorithm is based on determining whether 
a set of linear inequalities has or does not have a
solution.  The algorithm described in the paper is 
implemented in Fortran IV.
