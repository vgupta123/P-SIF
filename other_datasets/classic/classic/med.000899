a color test for the measurement of antibody to the non-acid-forming
human mycoplasma species.
   a metabolic inhibition test
for the measurement of
growth inhibiting antibodies to
the non-acid producing
human mycoplasma species is
described.  the test is
based upon the ability of these
organisms to metabolize
arginine with a resultant alkaline
shift in the ph of the
medium.  the alkaline shift is
inhibited by specific antiserum.
labile accessory factor(s)
present in unheated
guinea pig serum potentiates
the inhibitory effect of antiserum.
the test is sensitive
and specific for the measurement
of antibody to mycoplasmas
in rabbit immune
and human convalescent serum.
