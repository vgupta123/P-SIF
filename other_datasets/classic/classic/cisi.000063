The Publication Inflation
   The much-vaunted information explosion seems to be the manifestation of a 
rather generalized publication inflation.. Multipublication and pretentious
writing have become obstacles to "communication between human minds". To 
counteract their harmful effects it will be necessary to reduce the quantity 
and improve the quality of the printed records by filtering the material before 
it is stored for retrieval..
