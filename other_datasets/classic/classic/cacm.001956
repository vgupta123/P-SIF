Optimum Merging from Mass Storage
An algorithm is displayed which yields the merge orders such that the total
read time, defined to be the sum of seek time plus data-transfer
time, is minimized for a sort using mass storage. The analysis is
parameterized in terms of the ratio of seek time to the time it takes
to fill available core with records, and the file size in units
of core lengths; and thus it can be applied to any conventional
CPU/mass storage combination.  An explicit formula for total read
time is derived, in terms of the parameters, which correlates very
well with the total read time calculated using the optimum merge
orders yielded by the algorithm.  The formula involves the roots of a simple 
transcendental equation.  A short table of these roots
is included.  Numerical results are graphically displayed for a wide
range of the parameters.  It is found that the normalized read
time for optimum merging on a given hardware configuration is proportional
to the file length times the logarithm of the file length.
