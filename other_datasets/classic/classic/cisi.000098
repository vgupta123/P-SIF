Scientific Communication:
Its Role in the Conduct of Research and Creation of Knowledge
  There is considerable apprehension today
within the scientific community over the
communication crisis in science.  The present
article, which attempts to clarify certain aspects
of the problem, overviews the data collected by the
APA Project on Scientific Information Exchange in
Psychology, together with data which we have
more recently obtained relative to other disciplines.
Such a reexamination of the data should help to
clarify APA's relationship to the many information
media involved in the communication process
which begins with research and ends with the
incorporation of research findings into psychological
knowledge.
