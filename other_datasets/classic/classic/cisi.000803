Progress in Documentation
  The term 'informatics' was first advanced formally by the Director
of Viniti, A.I. Mikhailov, and his colleagues A.I. Chernyi and R.S.
Gilyarevskii, in their paper Informatics - new name for the theory of Scientific
Information published at the end of 1966.  An English translation was
circularized in the beginning of 1967.  As the authors state in this paper,
they are not the first to use this term, and they quote a review by Professor
J.G. Dorfmann of their own book Fundamentals of Scientific Information in
which Dorfmann criticizes the use of other terminology, such as 'documentation',
'documentalistics', 'information science', and so on.
  Their definition is as stated above but they are careful to add the rider that 
Informatics does not investigate the specific content of scientific information,
only the structure and properties.  In their paper they also advance definitions
for 'information', 'scientific information', 'scientific information activity',
'information officer', and 'information scientist'.  They have backed up their
proposal by changing the title of their own book for its second edition, and
the title of the information science fascicule of the Referativnyi Zhurnal,
which is now called Informatiki.
