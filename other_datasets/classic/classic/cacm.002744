Addition in an Arbitrary Base Without Radix Conversion
This paper presents a generalization of an
old programming technique; using it,one may add 
and subtract numbers represented in any radix, including
a mixed radix, and stored one digit per byte 
in bytes of sufficient size.  Radix conversion is unnecessary,
no looping is required, and numbers may 
even be stored in a display (I/O) format.  Applications
to Cobol, MIX, and hexadecimal sums are discussed.
