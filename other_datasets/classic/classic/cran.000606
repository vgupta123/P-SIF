formulae and approximations for aerodynamic heating rates in high speed
flight .
this note gives formulae and approximations suitable for making
preliminary estimates of aerodynamic heating rates in high speed flight .
the formulae are based on the /intermediate enthalpy/ approximation
which has given good agreement with theoretical and experimental
evidence . in the general flight case they could be used in conjunction with
 an analogue computer or a step-by-step method of integration to
predict the variations of heat flow and skin temperature with time .
in the restricted case of flight at constant altitude and mach number,
simple analytical methods and results are given which include the
effects of radiation and can be applied to /thick/ as well as /thin/ skins
where h is the aerodynamic heat transfer factor, and g, d and k are the
heat capacity, thickness and thermal conductivity of the skin . if 0.1
the skin is approximately /thin/, i.e. temperature gradients across its
thickness may be neglected .
