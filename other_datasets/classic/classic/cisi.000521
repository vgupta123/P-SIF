Compression of Bibliographic Files Using an Adaptation of Run-Length Coding
   Substantial degrees of compression of bibliographical data bases result from
the application to them a modified form of run-length coding.. The method
involves attenuation of the zero:one bit ratio of the data base.. This can be 
achieved by substitution of codes with the highest zero:one ratios the most
frequent symbols, or by substitution of 2-bytes codes for diagrams.. A form of
run-length coding in which the run-length is represented as a fixed-length
binary number is then applied..
