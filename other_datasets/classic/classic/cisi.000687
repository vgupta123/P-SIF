Index Chemicus Registry System:  Pragmatic Approach to
Substructure Chemical Retrieval
  The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS), launched in 1968 with the support
of a dozen industrial and governmental organizations, is now a current 
operational monthly service.  Subscribers receive magnetic tapes and printouts,
in which the weekly issues of Index Chemicus (IC) have been encoded in Wiswesser
Line Notations (WLN).  Over 13,000 compounds per month are provided in
machine language.  The canonical WLN is also provided in alphabetized printouts.
Encoding of over 400,000 new chemical compounds from IC has already been 
completed, including all those reported in 1967, 1968, and 1969.  Since the 
tapes also include title and other bibliographic information, this paper 
describes the use of supporting software provided for SDI search systems
employing "word" and other searching terms, in addition to the WLN fragments.
Use of the monthly and annual printouts are illustrated for those searches
which do not require computer manipulation.
