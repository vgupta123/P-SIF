available weighed less than 5 1/2 lbs., double the national rate for
prematurity.  there was a bi-modal distribution of mother's age at the birth of
the mongoloid child.  pregnancy, labor and delivery complications were
reported in almost one-half of the cases.  seven per cent were breech
deliveries.  all cases were mr.  the most frequent type was moderate.  most
frequently mentioned characteristics were: generalized hypotonia (all but 2
cases); psychiatric disorders, 11 cases; abnormal eeg, 8 cases; hearing loss,
5 cases.
