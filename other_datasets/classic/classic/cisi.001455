Work and the Nature of Man
  Work and the Nature of Man is the third book of a
trilogy concerning job attitudes.  In the first book,
Job Attitudes: Review of Research and Opinion, my
colleagues and I attempted to review and systematize
what had been gleaned from research and contemplation
after a half-century of effort.  In the Motivation to
Work that followed, we described an original research
study that offered a completely new hypothesis about the
way people feel about their jobs.  In this book, I have
taken that hypothesis and expanded it to a general theory
of Work and the Nature of Man.	While the trilogy contains
the three basic stages of scientific inquiry, knowledge
of what has gone before, new research and finally a
theory, the task that I set out for myself many years
ago, upon graduation for the School of Public Health
at the University of Pittsburgh, is just beginning.  
That task was to give original substance to the new 
discipline of Industrial Mental Health and, if possible,
to make some positive contributions.
