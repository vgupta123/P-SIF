The Cranfield II Relevance Assessments: A Critical Evaluation
   The relevance assessments belonging to the Cranfield II document/query
collection are shown to be faulty, in the sense that "many" relevant documents
were not so identified by the Cranfield judges.. The implications of these
omissions for the evaluation of information retrieval experiments based on the
Cranfield collection are examined in detail..It is shown that numerical measures
of retrieval effectiveness may be greatly altered bu consideration of the 
"missing" relevant documents and that a ranking  of retrieval methods according 
to order of performance may vary as well..
