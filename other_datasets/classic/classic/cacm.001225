The Predictive Analyzer and a Path Elimination Technique
Some of the characteristic features of a predictive
analyzer, a system of syntactic analysis 
now operational at Harvard on and IBM 7094, are delineated.
 The advantages and disadvantages of the 
system are discussed in comparison to those of an immediate
constituent analyzer, developed at the RAND 
Corporation with Robinson's English grammar.  In addition,
a new technique is described for repetitive 
path elimination for a predictive analyzer, which can
now claim efficiency both in processing time and 
core storage requirement.
