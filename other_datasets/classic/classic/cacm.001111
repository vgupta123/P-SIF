A Class of Iterative Techniques For the Factorization of Polynomials*
A method of iteration is developed in terms
of a function of somewhat arbitrary character. 
 Sufficient conditions are given for convergence of
the process, yielding factors of arbitrary degree 
for polynomials in one variable.  Both Lin's method
and Newton's method occur as special cases.
