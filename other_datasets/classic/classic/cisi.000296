Participative Management in Relation to Library Effectiveness
   This paper reviews a recent study on the influence of participative 
management on library performance.. Because most of the recent theoretical and 
empirical research being done in this area is ignored and an invalid measure of
participation in decision making is used, the study provides no basis for the
generalization that in increase in the library staff's participation in 
decision making will increase the library's effectiveness..
