The Making of a Library
A book like this is a cumulation of experience, thought, error, and
hopefully, learning of many years.  It did not start, like a water faucet, at
precisely that moment in 1967 when the Office of Education so kindly
awarded a grant to Hampshire college for the development of the concept
of the extended and experimenting library, although the grant was certainly
the means for, and a spur to, it formalization.
