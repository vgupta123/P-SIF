Impact of Scientific Serials on the Advancement of Medical
Knowledge:  An Objective Method of Analysis
  A common tool for the selection of serial publications for a research
library is the lists of most cited serials.  The possibilities of this method
were first studied by Gross and Gross who in 1927 applied a method of
sample statistical investigation to the grading of scientific serials
according to their relative importance based on citation counting from source
journals.
