A Statistical Interpretation of Term Specificity 
and Its Application in Retrieval
   The exhaustivity of document descriptions and the specificity of index terms
are usually regarded as independent.. It is suggested that specificity should be
interpreted statistically, as a function of term use rather than of term 
meaning.. The effect on retrieval of variations in term specificity are 
examined, experiments with three test collections showing in particular that
frequently-occurring terms are required for good overall performance.. It is
argued that terms should be weighted according to collection frequency, so that 
matches on less frequent, more specific, terms are of greater value than matches
on frequent terms.. Results for the test collections show that considerable 
improvements in performance are obtained with this very simple procedure..
