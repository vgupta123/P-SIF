steady-state creep through dislocation climb .
  a dislocation climb creep model is considered which does not require
the production of immobile dislocations .  the creep equation that
results from the analysis is
where a and b are constants, is the stress, q is the activation energy
of creep and kt has its usual meaning .  this equation is quite similar
to one previously proposed .
