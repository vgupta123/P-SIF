An Automatic Data Acquisition and Inquiry System Using Disk Files
Lockheed Missiles and Space Company has installed
a large-scale Automatic Data Acquisition 
(ADA) system which ties together the Company's manufacturing
facilities located in Van Nuys and Sunnyvale, 
California.  The system includes over 200 remote Input
Stations which collect and transmit Company operating 
data to a central Data Processing Center.  Two RCA 301
EDP Systems are used to record and control the 
flow of data transmitted to the Data Processing Center.
 A large capacity RCA 366 Data Disc File is used 
to store information required to provide up-to-date
information in response to inquiries received from 
remotely located Inquiry Stations.  In addition to storage
of data on the disk files, the system automatically 
records all incoming and outgoing data on magnetic tape
to be used as input to the Company's conventional 
off-line business data processing applications.
