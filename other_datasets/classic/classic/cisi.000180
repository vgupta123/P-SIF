Automated Information-Retrieval Systems (IRS)
  It is easiest of all to apply mechanization and automation to the
transmission, accumulation and search of information.  Automation
can also be extended to cover some more complicated functions.  In
all of these cases, the results supplied by automatic devices are
analysed and decisions are taken usually by man.  Thus, the role of
machine is to considerably extend man's capabilities rather than to
completely replace man. 
  The automated systems intended to accumulate and search for information
have come to be called information-retrieval systems (IRS).  These
systems can also perform the simpler forms of data processing.
The physical facilities of these systems are communications equipment,
punched-card computers, microfilming equipment, and electronic computers,
the latter playing the most prominent part.
