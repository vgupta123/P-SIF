calculation and compilation of the unsteady lift functions for a rigid
wing subjected to sinusoidal gusts and to sinusoidal sinking
oscillations .
the total lift responses of wings to sinusoidal gusts and to sinusoidal
vertical oscillations are calculated from the response to gust
penetration and to a sudden change in sinking velocity through use of the
well-established reciprocal relations for unsteady flow . the cases
considered are two-dimensional wings in incompressible, subsonic
compressible, sonic, and supersonic flow,. elliptical and rectangular wings
 in incompressible flow,. wide rectangular and delta wings in supersonic
 flow,. and delta wings of vanishingly low aspect ratio in
incompressible and compressible flow . for most of the cases considered,
closed-form expressions are given and the final results are presented in
 the form of plots of the square of the modulus of the lift coefficient
for wings in a sinusoidally oscillating gust and in the form of the real
 and imaginary parts of the lift component for wings undergoing
sinusoidal sinking oscillations . a summary table is presented as a guide to
 the scope and results of this paper,. this table contains the figure
and equation numbers for the types of flow and plan forms considered .
