A Simple Technique for Structured Variable Lookup
A simple technique for the symbol-table lookup
of structured variables based on simple automata 
theory is presented. The technique offers a deterministic
solution to a problem which is currently handled 
in a nondeterministic manner in PL/I and COBOL compilers.
