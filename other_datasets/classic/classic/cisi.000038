Machinelike Indexing by People
A study of several thousand entries in a classified bibliography
of article titles (the Index Medicus) revealed that a
large proportion of the title entries contained words identical
to or synonymous with words of the corresponding
subject heading.  It is inferred that a major part of the
bibliography studied could have been compiled by a machine
procedure operating on titles alone, provided the
machine was supplied with a suitable synonym dictionary.
