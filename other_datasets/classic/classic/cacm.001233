Conventions for the Use of Symbols in the Preparation
of Flowcharts for Information Processing 
Systems (A Standard Working Paper)
This paper is intended as an outline of the
various conventions which are being considered 
for the use of flowcharts for information processing
systems.  The conventions are applied to the use 
of the symbols appearing in the proposed American Standard
Flowchart Symbols and not with the symbols 
per se.
