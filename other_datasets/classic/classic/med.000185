the identification of lysosomal enzymes in bovine lens epithelium .     
  biochemical studies are described for the isolation of lysosomes      
(identified as such by the activities of their enzymes) in the cells of 
the bovine lens epithelium . the various fractions assayed for lysosomal
enzymes showed contamination of mitochondrial and soluble cytoplasmic   
material in the two isolation procedures employed .
