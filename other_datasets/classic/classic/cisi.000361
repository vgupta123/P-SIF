Documentation
  Since the first publication of this work Dr. Bradford has
died, and, a further edition now being called for, an attempt
has been made to recognize if not to deal with some criticisms
expressed on the first edition.
  The principal one was that whereas the book was entitled
"Documentation" it dealt in the main with the Universal
Decimal Classification, which Bradford did much to develop,
but that it neglected other aspects and instruments of the
subject of which the UDC is only one, even if an important
one, of various techniques.
