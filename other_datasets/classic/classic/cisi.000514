Evaluating the Effectiveness of an On-Line, 
Natural Language Retrieval System
   An evaluation of an on-line retrieval system known as EARS (Epilepsy 
Abstracts Retrieval System) has been performed.. The system, which permits the 
free text searching of approximately 8000 abstracts drawn from Epilepsy 
Abstracts, is supported by the National Institute of Neurological Diseases and 
Stroke (NINDS).. Specialists in the field of neurology, at six medical centers
in the United States, conducted on-line searches to satisfy their own needs for 
information.. Parallel searches were conducted on the same search topics by a 
neurologist at NINDS who was highly experienced in using the system.. The 
results of the original searches were evaluated in terms of recall, precision, 
and general user satisfaction.. A detailed analysis of factors affecting  the
success and failure of the on_line searches was carried out..
