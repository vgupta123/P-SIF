Classification Scheme for Law Books
  An examination made over a period of years of the principles of
classifying law books for use in libraries, and of their treatment in
many general and specialized classification schemes convinced me that
no scheme existed which was generally suitable for libraries in English-
speaking countries outside the United States.  Law collections in
academic libraries in the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth were
in a particularly difficult position.  They had the choice of adopting one
of the good American schemes, which generally make inadequate
provision for the needs of overseas Commonwealth libraries; or of
adopting one of the English schemes, each of which is virtually tailored
to a particular library, and several of which are even less well suited
to overseas libraries; or of devising new schemes for themselves.  There
seemed to be an urgent need for a practical law classification scheme
capable of being used in a variety of libraries, large and small, general
and special, academic and professional, in these countries.
