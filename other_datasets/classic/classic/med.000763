(cytological and cytochemical study of
hepatic cells in the human embryo)
changes in golgi apparatus and mitochondria as well as in the contents of
nucleic acids, proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and iron in the hepatic cells
of developing human embryo were studied; the data obtained in human embryos and
adults were compared.  it was found that during the developmental process some
changes in localisations of golgi apparatus and iron salts were taking place.
the contents of rna and polysaccharides in the cytoplasm increased:
mitochondria in the form of granules were revealed throughout the embryonic
period and in adults.  no essential alterations in the contents of dna,
proteins, and lipids were noted.
