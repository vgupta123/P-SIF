dipetalonema obtusa (mccoy,1936) comb. n. (filarioidea:
onchocercidae) in colombian primates, with a description of the adult
microfilaria obtusa mccoy, 1936, was identified in
the blood of 29 (31%) of 93 cebus
capucinus and c. albifrons from northern colombia, but was not
found in an additional 42 c. apella and
99 saimiri sciurea from other areas in colombia.  the adult male
and female, recovered from the peri-
esophageal connective tissue of the infected animals, are described
in detail.  dipetalonema obtusa (mc-
coy, 1936) comb. n. resembles tetrapetalonema marmosetae faust,
1935, but is smaller and the right
spicule is complex, not simple.
