Case Studies in Library Computer Systems
  Case Studies in Library Computer Systems does not follow the mode of
the other volumes in this series because none of the persons, libraries or
systems is disguised.  Neither has information been withheld to force readers
tp explore alternative choices, as in the usual case method.  Rather, all
systems are identified and described as accurately as possible.  Descriptive
case studies are problem-oriented, however, because they analyze a situation
in which a librarian had to decide if a computer could be successfully
utilized to solve the problem at hand.  The descriptive case method rather
than the problem case method was chosen because it seemed important to
describe each system in detail and to evaluate its performance in the context
of a real library environment and against the background of particular
institutional service objectives.
