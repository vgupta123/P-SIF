turbulent mixing of a rocket exhaust jet with a supersonic stream
including chemical reactions .
the equations for the turbulent mixing of a two-dimensional supersonic
jet issuing into an ambient supersonic stream are formulated . both
streams consist of a mixture of chemically active and possibly reacting
gases, therefore any heat release by chemical reaction is included,. the
 net mass rate of production of species is obtained on the assumption
that the reaction rate constant is given by an expression reducible to
the classical arrhenius law . the equations first given in terms of the
x, and y coordinates, are expressed in dimensionless form and in terms
of the x and coordinates, where is the stream function . the resulting
expressions are all of the /heat conduction/ type,. they are put in a
finite difference form by using the crank-nicolson method of
substituting finite difference approximations for both the /time/ and /space/
derivatives . the mixture is assumed to consist of six species, namely
h2o, h2, o2, co2, co, and n2, and the oxidation of h2 and co is assumed
to take place according to a single-step chemical reaction . the
solution of the problem is based on the simultaneous solution of 8n linear
algebraic equations in 8n unknowns, n being the number of internal grid
points at every step in the x-direction, and 8 the total number of
unknowns at each grid point, namely velocity, temperature, and
concentration for each of the six species . a method of obtaining initial and
boundary conditions from available inviscid jet flow solutions is
discussed . the equations are programed for calculation on an ibm-704
computer . finally, one typical case is considered, and plots of velocity,
temperature, and concentration profiles are given for the initial stages
 of development of the mixing layer .
