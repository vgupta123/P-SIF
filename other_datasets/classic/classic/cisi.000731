Evaluation of an SDI Service Based on the Index Chemicus Registry System
  The Index Chemicus Registry System (ICRS) is the
machine-readable equivalent of Current Abstracts in
Chemistry & Index Chemicus (CAC & IC).  In an earlier
paper, we described the development of an experimental
selective-dissemination-of-information (SDI) service
based on these tapes.  A detailed description of the
techniques of profile construction for searching a
Wiswesser Line Notation (WLN) structure file is given in
this earlier paper.  The present paper describes the evaluation
of the SDI service in terms both of quantitative measures
of retrieval performance, coverage and currency, and also of
user reactions to the service, as expressed in their replies
to a questionnaire.  Failure analysis techniques were used to
identify the reasons for retrieval failures and possible
methods for improving retrieval performance.  A fuller
description of the evaluation has been published in report
form.
