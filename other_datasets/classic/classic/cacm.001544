Tele-CUPL: A Telephone Time Sharing System
A general purpose, remote access, computing system
is described, that employs twelve-key keyboard 
telephones as terminals.  Audio output is provided directly
to the telephone terminals, but the system 
will normally be used in conjunction with remotely located
high speed printing devices.  The system is 
a compatible extension of an existing batch processing
system.  A significant element of the system is 
a scheme for transmitting alphanumeric information by single
strokes on a numeric keyboard.  The programmed 
scanner uses context to eliminate the ambiguity in transmission.
