A Monte Carlo Algorithm for Assigning Students to Classes
A technique of random choice is illustrated
by application to the problem of assigning students 
to a fixed schedule of courses.  Using the technique
it is possible to reduce or eliminate difficulties 
that result when a popular section is filled and closed
before all students requesting and requiring 
it have been scheduled.  The effectiveness of automatic
scheduling is retained without loss of the students 
privilege of picking favorite instructors.
