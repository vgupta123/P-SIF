experimentelle nierenvergroberung nach unilateraler
nephrektomie bei ratten
untersuchungen mit 3h-thymidin
in this paper it is attempted to clarify certain questions as to the mechanism
of compensatory renal hypertrophy by means of histological, cytological, and
autoradiographical examinations in nephrectomy experiments on young and grown
rats.  based on the results of this investigation the process of compensatory
renal hypertrophy must be imagined as follows:
as early as two hours after unilateral nephrectomy, a distinct increase of the
mitosis index without a simultaneous increase in dna-synthesizing cells was
observed in the remaining kidney.  it is assumed that a cell division of
polyploid cells is involved, which were in a prolonged premitotic rest phase.
after a latent period of 48 hours, the dna-synthesizing cells and dividing
cells start to increase.  the maximum of the regenerative processes is reached
between the 3rd and 4th day after nephrectomy.  twenty days after unilateral
nephrectomy, the regenerative processes are largely concluded.
all tubule sections participate in the compensatory renal hypertrophy.
although the regenerative processes are most marked in the central section,
one cannot speak of the development of an actual indifference zone in the
regenerating kidney.
in young test animals, compensatory renal hypertrophy is determined more
by mitotic cell division, in older test animals more by polyploidization
processes.
the results of these investigations provide no certain indications for the
assumption that amitotic nuclear divisions play a major part in compensatory
renal hypertrophy.
proliferation processes which in extent and localization run parallel to the
regeneration of the parenchyma, are also observed in the cells of the
connective tissue of the renal vessels.
