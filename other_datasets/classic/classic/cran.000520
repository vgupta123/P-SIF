wing-tail interference as a cause of 'magnus' effects
on a finned missile .
  wing-tail interference is shown to cause large /magnus/ effects
on a finned missile whose wings are deflected into an aileron
setting .  a simple experimental method with water as the
working medium is used to obtain low-speed magnus data on a rolling
missile .  the missile is a slender cruciform configuration with
all-movable wings and fixed tail fins .  magnus data are
presented for angles of attack up to 15 and for the one (high) roll
rate which accompanies a 30 aileron deflection angle of the
wings .  tests conducted at zero roll rate but with the wing
deflection maintained, revealed large forces in the magnus direction,
thereby providing the basis for understanding magnus effects due
to wing-tail interference .
  a semiempirical theory is proposed to explain the experimental
data .  a simplified model of the wake behind the wings is
introduced to predict tail-interference factors .  good agreement with
the data is obtained .
  this magnus effect is opposite in direction to the classical
magnus lift on a spinning cylinder ,. it is much larger than either
that effect or the one on a missile with only one set of fins .
wing-tail interference is the predominant source of the effect ,. roll rate
only modifies the basic interference mechanism .
