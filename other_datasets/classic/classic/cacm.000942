FORTRAN Subroutines for Time Series Analysis
The authors have recently been concerned in a
time-series study that constituted a fairly typical 
piece of applied statistical research, involving extensive
computations on a moderately large quantity 
of data.  Wehave found that the many different numerical
processes that were required could be built 
up almost completely from a small number of basic operations,
and a set of FORTRAN subroutines has been 
written to perform these.  The main purpose of this
note is to describe these subroutines, but since 
the question of general statistical programs is
topical [1], we include some general remarks.
