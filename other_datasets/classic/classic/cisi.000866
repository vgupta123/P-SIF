A MARC II - Based Program for Retrieval and Dissemination
   Subscriptions to the Library of Congress' MARC tapes number approximately 
sixty.. The use to which the weekly tapes have been put have been minimal in the
area of Selective Dissemination of Information (SDI) and current awareness.. 
This paper reviews work that has been performed on batched retrieval/
dissemination and provides a description of a highly flexible cooperative SDI 
system developed by the Library, University of Saskatchewan, and the National 
Science Library.. The system will permit searching over all subject areas 
represented by the English language monographic literature on MARC..
