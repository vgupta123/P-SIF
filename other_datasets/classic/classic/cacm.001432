Incorporation of Nonstandard Input/Output Devices into FORTRAN Systems
A FORTRAN system may readily be modified to
handle input/output with nonstandard media on the 
same basis on which it handles the standard media.  This
is done by providing a character-handling subroutine 
suited to the nonstandard medium and arranged to be called
by an otherwise unused output statement type 
or unit number. This method was used to control output
of alphanumeric information on a digital graph 
plotter.
