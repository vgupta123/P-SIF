experimental investigation at mach numbers 3. 0 of
the effects of thermal stress and buckling on the flutter
of four-bay aluminium alloy panels with length-width
ratios of 10 .
  skin-stiffener aluminum alloy panels consisting of four bays, each
bay having a length-width ratio of 10, were tested at a mach number
of 3.0 at dynamic pressures ranging from 1,500 psf to 5,000 psf and at
stagnation temperatures from 300 f to 655 f .  the panels were
restrained by the supporting structure in such a manner that partial thermal
expansion of the skins could occur in both the longitudinal and lateral
directions .
  a boundary faired through the experimental flutter points
consisted of a flat-panel portion, a buckled-panel portion, and a
transition point at the intersection of the two boundaries .  in the region
where a panel must be flat when flutter occurs, an increase in panel
skin temperature (or midplane compressive stress) makes the panel more
susceptible to flutter .  in the region where a panel must be buckled
when flutter occurs, the flutter trend is reversed .  this reversal in
trend is attributed to the panel postbuckling behavior .
