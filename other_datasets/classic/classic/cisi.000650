Relative Effectiveness of Titles, Abstracts, and Subject Headings 
for Machine Retrieval from the COMPENDEX Services
   We have investigated the relative merits of searching on titles, subject 
headings, abstracts, free-language terms, and combinations of these elements..
The COMPENDEX data base  was used for this study since it contained all of the
data elements of interest.. In general, the results obtained from the 
experiments indicate that, as expected, titles alone are not satisfactory for 
efficient retrieval.. The combination of titles and abstracts came the closest 
to 100% retrieval, with searching of abstracts alone doing almost as well..
Indexer input, although necessary for 100% retrieval in almost all cases, was
found to be relatively unimportant..
