On-Line Systems: Promise and Pitfalls
   Interactive systems, in existence for nearly 15 years, are becoming
increasingly important, both for information retrieval and library support
operations.. The virtues of these systems are speed, intimacy, and -
if time-sharing is involved - economy.. The major problems are the cost of
the large computers and files necessary for bibliographic data, the still-
high cost of communications, and the generally poor design of the user-
system interfaces.. The desirable features of on-line retrieval interfaces
are only now being defined and tested in a systematic way, e.g., by the
National Library of Medicine in its AIM-TWX nationwide experimental
retrieval service.. System implementers must, in addition to engineering
the right capabilities into on-line systems, also make a careful, 
concerted effort to engineer user acceptance.. Common pitfalls here
include overselling system capabilities and failure to take into account
the social context around the user terminal.. The major national problem
is to avoid or limit wasteful and expensive duplication in providing
nationwide search access to the hundreds of public and private data
bases that will be readily available during the next few years.. We do
not need technological breakthroughs to exploit the potential of
on-line systems, but we do need breakthroughs in organizing for
technological change..
