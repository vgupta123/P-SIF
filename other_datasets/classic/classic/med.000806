a twenty-five year view of
therapeutic results
thus this group of ten patients shows a complete range of
chronic schizophrenia from a bright pseudoneurotic never hospitalized,
to an inaccessible patient chronically hospitalized for 20 years.
physiological therapy in the form of metrazol-induced convulsions
given in the course of a puberty schizophrenic psychosis, has been
helpful to some by making them more accessible for the total treat-
ment program in the hospital or by raising their margin of tolerance
sufficiently so that they could live at home and attend public schools
at least for a time and at best, indefinitely.
several of the most regressed, deteriorated patients in state hospitals
for many years, have been brought back to some level of meaningful
living again by the current drug therapy program, and are still im-
proving.
now we have not determined who the sinner may be.  there are
many who will believe that the mother is always the sinner; is she
not schizophrenogenic?  there are others who will believe that the
individual himself is the sinner since, after all, is he not the one
whose behavior and fantasies are schizophrenic?  however, there will
be many of you attending this fifty-second annual meeting of the
american psychopathological association, who will judge the speaker
to be the sinner, for have i not given you this wealth of clinical ma-
terial without charts, graphs, or statistical evaluation?
