The Development and Administration of automated systems 
in Academic Libraries
   The first part of this paper considers three general approaches to the
development of an automation program in a large research library.. The library
may decide simply to wait for developments; it may attempt to develop a total 
or integrated system from the start; or it may adopt an evolutionary approach
leading to an integrated system.. Outside consultants,it is suggested, will 
become increasingly important.. The second part of the paper deals with 
important elements in any program regardless of the approach.. These include
the building of a capability to do automation work, staffing, equipment,
organizational structure, selection of projects, and costs..
