a second order shock-expansion method applicable to
bodies of revolution near zero lift .
  a second-order shock-expansion
method applicable to bodies of
revolution near zero lift is developed .
expressions defining the pressures on
noninclined bodies are derived by the
use of characteristics theory in
combination with properties of the flow
predicted by the generalized
shock-expansion method .  this result is
extended to inclined bodies to
obtain expressions for the normal-force
and pitching-moment derivatives
at zero angle of attack .  the method is
intended for application under
conditions between the ranges of applicability
of the second-order
potential theory and the generalized shock-expansion
mehtod - namely, when the
ratio of free-stream mach number to nose fineness
ratio is in the
neighborhood of 1 .
  for noninclined bodies, the pressure
distributions predicted by the
second-order shock-expansion method are
compared with existing experimental
results and with predictions of other
theories .  for inclined bodies, the
normal-force derivatives and locations
of the center of pressure at zero
angle of attack predicted by the method
are compared with experimental
results for mach numbers from 3.00 to 6.28 .
fineness ratio 7, 5, and 3
cones and tangent ogives were tested alone
and with cylindrical afterbodies
up to 10 diameters long .  in general, the
predictions of the present method
are found to be in good agreement with the
experimental results .  for
non-inclined bodies, pressure distributions
predicted with the method are in
good agreement with existing experimental
results and with distributions
obtained with the method of characteristics .
for inclined bodies, the
normal-force derivatives per radian (for
normal-force coefficients
referenced to body base area) are predicted
within 0.2 and the locations of
the center of pressure are predicted
within 0.2 body diameters .  on the
basis of these results, the
second-order shock-expansion method appears
applicable for values of the ratio
of free-stream mach number to nose
fineness ratio from 0.4 to 2 .
