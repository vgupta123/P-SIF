On Quadratic Adaptive Routing Algorithms
Two analytic models of a store-and-forward communications
network are constructed, one to find 
the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate
the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained 
by an adaptive routing algorithm.  These models show that
adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary 
conditions for an optimal routing,  Adaptive routing tends
to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate 
routes because it does not consider the impact of its
current routing decision on the future state of 
the network.  The form of the optimality conditions suggests
that a modification of the adaptive algorithm 
will result in optimality.  The modification requires
the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead 
of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each
network node.  Simulation results are presented 
which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.
