A Programmer's Description of L^6
Bell Telephone Laboratories' Low-Linked List Language
L^6 (pronounced "L-six") is a new programming 
language for list structure manipulations.  It contains
many of the facilities which underlie such list 
processors as IPL, LISP, COMIT ad SNOBOL, but permits
the user to get much closer to machine code in 
order to write faster-running programs, to use storage
more efficiently and to build a wider variety 
of linked data structures.
