An Allocation Formula Derived from a Factor Analysis of Academic Department
   The authors derive a book fund distribution formula from a factor analysis 
of twenty-two variables which measure and quantify academic departments.. The
analysis generates a 22 x 22 matrix of correlations.. A few of the significant
correlations are discussed; e.g. those between books published and books 
circulated (high correlation) and circulation-by-subject and 
circulation-by-person (low correlation).. The factor analysis sorts out the 
complex relationships between the twenty-two variables and reduces them to 
three main factors - two of which seem to describe materials used and users.. 
The third may describe needs.. The three factors are the chief elements in the 
formula.. Each factor can be represented by any one or more of the variables 
in that factor..
