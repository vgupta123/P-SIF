Stereochemically Unique Naming Algorithm
   An algorithm has been developed and implemented to generate for each 
chemical structure a unique and invariant linear name which includes double 
bond and asymmetric carbon isomerism.. A logical proof is given for the 
one-to-one correspondence between name and structure.. By inspection of the
linear names of two structures, one can determine if the two structures are
identical, nonisometric, constitutionally isometric, diastereometric, or
enantiometric.. The algorithm determines the true stereocenters and calculates
a reduced set of chiral centers, Src.. It is proven that if three are any 
centers in Src that the compound must be chiral; an a chiral compound must have 
Src = null.. Extensions of the algorithm are outlined to allow uniquely naming 
conformational isomers..
