application of second-order shock-expansion theory
to several types of bodies of revolution .
  second-order shock-expansion theory is utilized to obtain equations
for the initial normal force curve slope, initial pitching moment curve
slope, and zero-lift wave drag for several type bodies of revolution .
bodies considered are the cone-cylinder, cone-cylinder-frustum,
cone-cylinder-frustum-booster, cone-frustum, and cone-frustum booster .
