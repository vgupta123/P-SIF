PERT Time Calculations Without Topological Ordering
A simplified technique is presented for PERT
Time calculations without topological ordering. 
 Each event is assigned a unique memory location.  An activity
is represented by a link.  A link is defined 
as a memory location containing the address of another
memory location.  The time information for an 
activity is carried with its link.  For a typical net,
the majority of activities can be described by 
one 36-bit cell each.  The remainder use two 36-bit
cells each.  The links are unidirectional; forward 
during the T(E) calculation (expected completion time for
an activity);backward during the T(L) calculation 
(time latest allowable for completion of an activity). 
The calculations progress through the net topologically 
even though the net is not represented topologically in core.
