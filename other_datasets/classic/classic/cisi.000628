The Environment of Classification:
The Concept of Mutual Exclusivity
   It has been suggested that information science is still of the stage
of alchemy:  if this is so then mutual exclusivity must form its
philosopher's stone.. Mutual exclusivity appears to be alien to the
observable universe:  that this is so is displayed through a series of
examples.. Some of these relate to everyday things like trees, beaches
and man himself,  whilst others relate to more obscure phenomena like
continental drift and black holes.. The act of observation is also
considered as this has a considerable bearing on the problem..
   Nevertheless, mutual exclusivity must form part of man's mental
powers and this has found expression in the relatively exclusive
series of symbols used in communication.. The dangers of exclusive
thinking in relation to environmental problems are considered, and
this results in a paradox which is probably unresolvable.. Finally, it
is observed that out-standing genius appears to pay scant regard to
existing classifications and is more likely to be involved in an
integrated approach to problems..
