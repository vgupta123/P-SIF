an experimental study of the turbulen coundary layer
on a shock tube wall .
  interferometric measurements were made of the density profiles of
an unsteady turbulent boundary layer on the flat wall of a shock tube .
the investigation included both subsonic and supersonic flow (mach
numbers of 0.50 and 1.77) with no pressure gradient and with heat transfer
to a cold wall .  velocity profiles and average skin-friction
coefficients were calculated .  effects on the velocity profile of
surface roughness and flow length are examined .
