An Experimental Evaluation of Data Type Conventions
The language in which programs are written
can have a substantial effect on the reliability 
of the resulting programs.  This paper discusses an experiment
that compares the programming reliability 
of subjects using a statically typed language and a "typeless"
language.  Analysis of the number of errors 
and the number of runs containing errors shows that, at
least in one environment, the use of a statically 
typed language can increase programming reliability. 
Detailed analysis of the errors made by the subjects 
in programming solutions to reasonably small problems
shows that the subjects had difficulty manipulating 
the representation of data.
