new developments in the nonlinear theories of the buckling of thin
cylindrical shells .
in the present paper a short survey will be given first of the buckling
and postbuckling behavior of isotropic cylindrical shells subjected
to different loading conditions as obtained by the nonlinear theory
of finite deflections of shells during the last twenty years .
next a report will be given on new investigations carried out in the
structures department of the dvl concerning the elastic stability of
isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical shells loaded in axial compression
and internal pressure .  these studies are based on the nonlinear theory
of finite deformations .  the theoretical rsults will be compared with
new experimental results obtained with a series of axially loaded
pressurized isotropic and orthotropic cylindrical shells .
