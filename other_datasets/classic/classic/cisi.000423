R and D Project Selection:  Where We Stand
   A review of the literature on R and D project selection and an analysis of 
interview data suggest that there is a lack of testing and use of the methods
proposed.. Several OR-MS methods are identified and their current status is
indicated.. Three representative procedures are examined in some detail.. It is
argued that both a lack of testing concerning feasibility and shortcomings of
the models themselves, help to explain why the methods have not been used.. 
Some of these shortcomings are identified and discussed.. Implications for 
future research are presented..
