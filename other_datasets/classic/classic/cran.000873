lagrangian thermodynamics of heat transfer in systems
including fluid motion .
  the lagrangian thermodynamic equations of irreversible
processes are extended to convective heat transfer .  this
generalization provides equations for the unified analysis of transient
heat flow in complex systems comprising solid structures and
moving fluids in either laminar or turbulent flow .  the concept
of a surface-heat-transfer coefficient is eliminated from the
formulation .  the theory is developed along two different lines .  in
one approach a new concept referred to as the /trailing function/
is introduced .  it represents the surface-heat-transfer properties
and may be evaluated by quite simple but remarkably accurate
variational procedures .  the method of /associated fields/ is also
generalized to convective phenomena .  the second line of
approach extends to convective heat transfer the thermodynamic
concept of entropy production for both laminar and turbulent
flow .  the theory amounts to an extension of the
thermodynamics of irreversible processes to systems for which onsager's
relations are not valid .
