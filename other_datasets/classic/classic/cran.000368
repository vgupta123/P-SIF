some problems of polar missile control .
  a polar-controlled missile is one in which manoeuvre
is carried out by rotations about roll and pitch axes,
that is, in the manner of a conventional aeroplane .  this
paper discusses some problems in the application of this
form of control to homing missiles .
  in comparison with the alternative cartesian
configuration, this method presents some special design
problems .  in the former case, it is often possible to
resolve the motion into two planes and consider the
pitch and yaw control systems as independent
two-dimensional problems .  this simplification is not
possible in the case of polar control and it is usually
necessary to consider the whole three-dimensional
system .  the equations of motion which result are, in
general, not susceptible to analysis .  because of this,
the design of control systems requires extensive use of
simulators .
