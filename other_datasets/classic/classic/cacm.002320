Structured Multiprogramming
This paper presents a proposal for structured
representation of multiprogramming in a high 
level language.  The notation used explicitly associates
a data structure shared by concurrent processes 
with operations defined on it.  This clarifies the meaning
of programs and permits a large class of time-dependent 
errors to be caught at compile time.  A combination of
critical regions and event variables enables the 
programmer to control scheduling of resources among
competing processes to any degree desired.  These 
concepts are sufficiently safe to use not only within
operating systems but also within user programs.
