a study of the cantilever square plate subjected to
a uniform loading .
  plate problems involving free edges have been historically
difficult to solve, particularly when two free edges are adjacent,
resulting in a free corner .  the cantilevered square plate
subjected to a transverse loading is one such problem for which an
exact solution has not been achieved .
  in the present paper results obtained by various approximate
methods are presented for this problem for the case of a uniform
loading .  solutions obtained by the authors using the technique
of point matching and the rayleigh-ritz method are compared
with previously published finite-difference and experimental
results and with bernoulli-euler beam and plane-strain approaches .
numerical results for deflections, slope components, bending and
twisting moments, and transverse distributed shears are presented
for a relatively fine gridwork of points on the plate boundary
and within the interior .  the antielastic curvature is exhibited by
all methods except beam theory .  all methods present the
interesting conclusion that the free edge deflection is greater when
the plate is treated as a plate rather than a beam .
