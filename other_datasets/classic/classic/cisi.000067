The Use of Simulation in Studying Information Storage and Retrieval Systems
   Previous applications of simulation to information storage and retrieval 
systems (ISRS) have been overly restrictive in their scope and have failed to
consider the environment within which such systems operate.. This paper 
considers the ISRS as a subsystem within a larger system which includes the 
users and the funders of the retrieval system.. The three components form a 
closed-loop information feedback system in which user response influences both 
the funding and operation of the ISRS as it attempts to satisfy user needs 
within a finite budget allocation.. Reward-cost theory provides the basis for
describing user behavior.. An industrial dynamics model has been developed to 
simulate ISRS/user/funder behavior where a university departmental library is 
the ISRS component.. The results which such an analysis can produce are 
discussed..
