axisymmetric magnetohydrodynamic channel flow .
  the axisymmetric subsonic and supersonic flow fields, and the
skin friction and heat transfer of an electrically conducting
compressible fluid flowing in a channel of constant circular area
through a magnetic field are investigated when the magnetic
reynolds number is small .  the inviscid-flow field for flow
through a dipole field is solved by the method of characteristics
in the supersonic case .  for the subsonic case, linearized
equations are derived for small values of the magnetic interaction
parameter .  numerical results are obtained by the relaxation
method .
  the inviscid-flow-field solutions are used as boundary
conditions for the laminar boundary layer along the wall, in which
axial pressure gradients form an important feature .  the exact
continuum-flow equations are reduced by an order-of-magnitude
analysis to the boundary-layer equations, which are solved
numerically by an integral method using a fourth-degree velocity
profile and a fifth-degree stagnation-enthalpy profile .
  pressure, temperature, and heat-transfer measurements are
made with a shock tube under supersonic-flow conditions closely
approaching those used in the numerical computations .
general agreement is found between the theoretical and the
experimental results .
