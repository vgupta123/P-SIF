Ballistic Cam Design 
This paper presents a digital computer program
for the rapid calculation of manufacturing data 
essential to the design of preproduction cams which
are utilized in ballistic computers of tank fire 
control systems.  The cam profile generated introduces
the superelevation angle required by tank main 
armament for a particular type ammunition.
