Citation Indexes
  Citation indexing is a relatively new method of organizing the contents of a
collection of documents in a way that overcomes many of the shortcomings of the
more traditional indexing methods.  The primary advantage of citation indexing
is that it identifies relationships between documents that are often overlooked
in a subject index.  An important secondary advantage is that the compilation 
of citation indexes is especially well suited to the use of man-machine indexing
methods that do not require indexers who are subject specialists.  Furthermore,
citations, which are bibliographic descriptions of documents, are not 
vulnerable to scientific and technological obsolescence as are the terms used
in subject indexes.
