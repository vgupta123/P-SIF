What Information Dissemination Studies Imply Concerning the Design of
On-Line Reference Retrieval Systems*
   The use of an on-line computer system for locating bibliographic citations
has been hailed as an important innovation for coping with the "information
explosion.." However, on-line reference retrieval is only one element in a
large social system of information dissemination.. To have a widespread impact,
an on-line system must compete successfully with a multitude of other sources
of references.. This paper reviews studies of information dissemination as a
basis for determining how on-line retrieval can best compete.  It recommends
the functional groups for whom an on-line system should be designed and the
forms of written media that should be included in the system's initial data
base.. Finally, it presents criteria the system should satisfy to be as widely
used and as comprehensive as other reference retrieval methods..
