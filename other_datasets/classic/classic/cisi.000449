Situational Relevance
   The concept of situational relevance is introduced, based on W.S.Cooper's
definitions of logical relevance, on the notion of evidential relevance drawn
from inductive logic, on the notions of a personal stock of knowledge and a set 
of personal concerns, the latter explained in terms of preferences over ranges 
of alternatives.. Situationally relevant items of information are those that 
answer, or logically help to answer, questions of concern.. Significant 
situationally relevant information is explained in terms of changes of view in 
relation to questions of concern.. It is claimed that situational relevance is 
an explication of the ordinary notion of practical relevance, and that it is 
the appropriate relevance concept to use in evaluation of systems supplying 
practically relevant information..
