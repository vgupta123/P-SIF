influence coefficients for real gases .
influence coefficients for real gases .
in the analysis of one-dimensional fluid-flow problems, it is often
assumed that the behavior of the medium is that of a perfect gas .
this assumption is justified, provided the pressure and temperature
range of interest is small and near atmospheric .  at higher pressures
and temperatures various deviations are introduced thereby causing
deviations from the results obtained by using the ideal fluid-flow
equations .
in this note, influence coefficients, similar to those developed by
shapiro, are presented for the case of real gases .  this analysis is
based upon the use of various functions of the compressibility factor
emmons .  some of the assumptions made were as follows..  (1) the flow
is one-dimensional and steady, (2) changes in the stream properties
are continuous, and (3) the flow is comprised of imperfect gases
