structural acoustic proof testing .
with the introduction of high-powered
propulsion systems, and paralleling their
continued development, an
accompanying increase in acoustical problems has arisen .
  of these acoustical problems, that of
acoustical fatigue failures has become paramount
in the eyes of the structural engineer .  aircraft
designed to normal strength requirements have
been known literally to fall apart under acoustical
loading .  this problem has required much
endeavour to produce a solution, and considerable
structural research, based upon results of siren or
other testing, have proved inadequate .  this
failure to find a satisfactory solution has resulted
in the conviction that the final proof of a design
can be found only in proof testing .  proof testing,
in the acoustic fatigue sense, is the testing of a
design structure in a simulated acoustical
environment for a period of time long enough to assure
equality with design life .
