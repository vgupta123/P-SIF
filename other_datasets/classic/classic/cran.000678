the effect of end plates on swept wings .
  existing methods of calculating
the effect of endplates on straight
wings are modified so as to apply to
swept wings .  the changes in overall
lift and drag, and also the spanwise
distribution of the additional load,
can be calculated .
  the theoretical results are
compared with experimental results
obtained on swept wings, including
new measurements of lift, drag and
pitching moment, made on an untapered
  the method of calculation is also
extended to cover the effect of
the tip vortex which is formed on wings
without endplates .
