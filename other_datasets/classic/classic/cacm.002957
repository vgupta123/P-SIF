Database Abstractions: Aggregation
Aggregation is in troduced as an abstraction
which is important in conceptualizing the real 
world.  Aggregation transforms a relationship between
objects into a higher-level object.  A new data 
type, called aggregation, is developed which, under
certain criteria of "well-definedness," specifies 
aggregation abstractions.  Relational databases defined
as collections of aggregates are structured as 
a hierarchy on n-ary relations.  To main tain well-definedness,
update operations on such databases must 
preserve two invariants.  Well-defined relations are
distinct from relations in third normal form.  It 
is shown that these notions are complementary and both are
important in database design.  A top-down 
methodology for database design is described which separates
decisions concerning aggregate structure 
from decisions concerning key identification.  It is
suggested that aggregate types, and other types 
which support real-world abstractions without in troducing
implementation detail, should be incorporated 
into programming languages.
