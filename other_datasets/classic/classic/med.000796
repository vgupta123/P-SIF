the management of disseminated
cancer of the breast
when mammary cancer has spread to tissues beyond
the breast and axilla, the disease is incurable by present
day methods.  however the patient may be greatly helped
and tumor growth retarded by skillful and sympathetic
application of irradiation, surgical ablation, hormone ad-
ministration, and chemotherapy.  given in conjunction
with analgesics, sedatives, and ataractic drugs, these
measures can frequently reduce disability and pain and
prolong the period of useful comfortable life.
