Optimal Starting Approximations for Generating
Square Root for Slow or No Divide
On machine with slow or no division, it is preferable to
use an iterative scheme for the square root different from
the classical Heron scheme.  The problem of optimal initial 
approximants is considered, and some optimal polynomial initial 
approximations are tabulated.
