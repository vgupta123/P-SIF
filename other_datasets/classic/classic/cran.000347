boundary layer measurements in hypersonic flow .
  experimental data are presented on boundary-layer formation,
heat transfer, and skin-friction coefficient at mach numbers of
the wall of a conical nozzle in the presence of a favorable pressure
gradient and several rates of heat transfer .  the reynolds
number based on momentum thickness varied from 1,500 to 3,500 .
comparison is made with data at lower mach numbers and with
the semiempirical theory of von karman .  the existing data up
to mach numbers of nine indicate agreement to within 5 per
cent when compared with a form of the wilson theory, but it is
clear that the effects of heat transfer and pressure gradients
present problems which require extensive study and experiment in
the future .
