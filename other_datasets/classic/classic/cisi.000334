Concepts and Subject Headings
        Librarians are known for their organizational work
with recorded knowledge.  Information storage and retrieval
are two well-known, basic functions associated with this
work.  A search of the literature of library science reveals
that these functions have not been examined to any significant
degree from the users' point of view.  This is true in regard
to library catalogs and library subject headings.
