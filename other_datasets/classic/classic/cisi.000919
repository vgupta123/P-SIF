ISBD(S) and Title Main Entry for Serials
  The International Meeting of Cataloguing Experts,
convened in Copenhagen in 1969 under the auspices
of the IFLA Committee on Uniform Cataloguing
Rules (later Committee on Cataloguing), set in
motion the first major development in continuation
of the success achieved by the Paris International
Conference on Cataloguing Principles (1961) in the
matter of the principles and general rules for entry
and heading.  Taking under consideration the study of
"Bibliographical Data in National Bibliography Entries"
prepared by Michael Gorman, the experts of
the Copenhagen meeting set up a working group, with
Jack Wells as chairman, charged with drafting an
international standard bibliographic description for
monographic publications.  There was common
agreement that the objective was the development of
specifications for the necessary data elements, their
order of presentation, and the punctuation to delimit
them.  These specifications should be designed to
satisfy the needs of national bibliographies, and,
with whatever judicious trimming might be desirable,
the needs of the libraries of the entire world.  It was
further agreed that these bibliographic descriptions
were to be made quite independently of the heading
under which they might appear in listings.  The working
group succeeded in its task and brought forth its
provisional ISBD(M) in 1971; the first standard
edition was published earlier this year.  The success of
this standard is manifested by the continuing increase
in the number of countries that have adopted it.
