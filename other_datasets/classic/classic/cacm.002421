A Scan Conversion Algorithm with Reduced Storage Requirements
Most graphics systems using a raster scan output
device (CRT or hardcopy) maintain a display 
file in the XY or random scan format.  Scan converters,
hardware or software, must be provided to translate 
the picture description from the XY format to the raster
format.  Published scan conversion algorithms 
which are fast will reserve a buffer area large enough
to accommodate the entire screen.  On the other 
hand, those which use a small buffer area are slow because
they require multiple passes through the XY 
display file.  The scan conversion algorithm described
here uses a linked list data structure to process 
the lines of the drawing in strips corresponding to
groups of scan lines.  A relatively small primary 
memory buffer area is used to accumulate the binary image
for a group of scan lines.  When this portion 
of the drawing has been plotted, the buffer is reused for
the next portion.  Because of the list processing 
procedures used, only a single pass through the XY display
file is required when generating the binary 
image and only a slight increase in execution time over
the fully buffered core results.  Results slow 
that storage requirements can be reduced by more than
80 percent while causing less than a 10 percent 
increase in execution time.
