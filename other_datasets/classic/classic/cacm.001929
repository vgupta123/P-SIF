Images from Computers and Microfilm Plotters
Digital computers are widely used for the
processing of information and data of all kinds, 
including the pictorial information contained in photographs
and other graphical representations.  Efficient 
conversion facilities for putting graphical information
into the computer and retrieving it in graphical 
form are therefore much needed.  One of the most commonly
employed devices for obtaining permanent graphical 
output from digital computers is the microfilm plotter.
 Regrettably, present models have no provision 
for producing images with a continuous gray scale or "half tones."
 In this note several programming techniques 
are described for obtaining half tone pictures from a
microfilm plotter under the control of a digital 
computer.  Illustrative examples of several methods are given.
