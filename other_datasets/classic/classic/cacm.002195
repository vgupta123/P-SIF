On the Optimal Detection of Curves in Noisy Pictures
A technique for recognizing systems of lines
is presented.  In this technique the heuristic 
of the problem is not embedded in the recognition algorithm
but is expressed in a figure of merit.   
A multistage decision process is then able to recognize
in the input picture the optimal system of lines 
according to the given figure of merit.  Due to the
global approach, greater flexibility and adequacy 
in the particular problem is achieved.  The relation
between the structure of the figure of merit and 
the complexity of the optimization process is then discussed.
 The method described is suitable for parallel 
processing because the operations relative to each
state can be computed in parallel, and the number
of stages is equal to the length N of the curves (or
to log2 N if the approximate method is used).
