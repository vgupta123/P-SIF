Backtrack Programming Techniques
The purpose of this paper is twofold.  First,
a brief exposition of the general backtrack technique 
and its history is given.  Second, it is shown how the use
of macros can considerably shorten the computation 
time in many cases.  In particular, this technique has allowed
the solution of two previously open combinatorial 
problems, the computation of new terms in a well-known
series, and the substantial reduction in computation 
time for the solution to another combinatorial problem.
