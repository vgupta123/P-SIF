Library of Congress
  The book was built on interviews with the Library's middle
managers, on discussions with working specialists in the
various divisions, on conversations with and questionnaires
sent to out-of-Library users, and from my own observations
through almost twenty-five years in the Library's Congressional
Research Service.  After the text was completed, it was read
by appropriate people in each department for factual content
and ultimately by the staff in the Librarian's Office for
their comment.  At no point was there pressure to change text
or conclusions - although there were plenty of good-natured
suggestions on details, and nearly everyone urged a fuller
description of his own particular specialty!
