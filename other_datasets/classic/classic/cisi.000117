TOSAR - A Topological method for the Representation of Synthetic and 
Analytical Relations of Concepts
   In mechanized systems used for searching in literature stores there is a 
steadily growing necessity not only to be able to formulate concepts as a
search condition but also the characteristic connections under which these
concepts appear in the inquiry.. In this way the precision of the mechanized
literature search is considerably increased.. TOSAR has been developed in 
order to improve computerized literature searching in this respect..
