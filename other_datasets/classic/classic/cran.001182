an approximate solution for laminar boundary layer flow .
this paper presents an approximate solution for two-dimensional,
incompressible, laminar boundary layer flow with arbitrary pressure
gradient . von mises' form of the boundary layer equation is linearized
by making a change in the coefficient of one of the terms .  the
linearized equation yields a solution that is accurate for the outer portion
of the flow but inaccurate near the surface .  a separate inner solution
then is developed which is accurate at the surface and which joins with
the outer solution at some point within the boundary layer .  the
method may be considered a major modification of one developed earlier
by von karman and millikan, with changes in both outer and inner
solutions, and the point at which the two solutions are joined .  the changes
improve the accuracy of the method and in some respects simplify the
calculations .  as examples, results are presented for flow with a
linear variation of velocity (including flat plate and stagnation
point flow as special cases), flow with sinusoidal variation of
velocity, flow past a circular cylinder (heimenz' velocity
distribution), and flow past an ellipse (schubauer's data) . agreement
with theoretically exact solutions is good, and better than
results obtained using the pohlhausen method .
