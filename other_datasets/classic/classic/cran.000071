laminar boundary layer behind shock advancing into
stationary fluid .
  a study was made of the laminar compressible boundary layer induced
by a shock wave advancing into a stationary fluid bounded by a wall .
for weak shock waves, the boundary layer is identical with that which
occurs when an infinite wall is impulsively set into uniform motion
shocks .
  velocity and temperature profiles, recovery factors, and
skin-friction and heat-transfer coefficients are tabulated for a wide range
of shock strengths .
