The Divided Catalog: A Summary of the Literature
  In the earliest item (1905) in the bibliography here presented, Fletcher
challenges the right of the dictionary catalog to be the overwhelmingly
predominant type of catalog in libraries.  He questions its advocates' claim
that it best meets a library's needs.  He advocates a divided catalog such as
the one at Amherst because, for one thing, the separate catalog
can more readily be used in conjunction with bibliographies in the subject
fields.  We find a similar argument in the latest item in the bibliography
(Harris, 1957).  Fletcher's article seems to have been followed by more
than thirty years of silence in the library journals on the subject
of the divided catalog.  During that period there were probably some
divisions of catalogs at some libraries but, as Thom (q.v.) indicates, the
greatest period of such activity started in 1937.  Our survey of the
literature on the divided catalog corroborates this since 1938 in the year
in which the steady stream of papers on the subject began.
