Computerized Library Catalogs: Their Growth, Cost and Utility
  This book is a slightly modified form of a report on computerized
library catalogs prepared for the Office of Education of the United States
Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (Contract OEC-1-7-
071182-5013).  It consists of seven chapters.  The first poses the problems
that have been studied, introduces background material to facilitate an
understanding of their significance, and presents our conclusions and
general recommendations.  The remaining chapters belong to one of two
parts, depending on whether their principle concern is the utility or the
cost of computeerized library catalogs.  Because the problem of utility is the
more speculative of the two, it has been placed in the second part.
