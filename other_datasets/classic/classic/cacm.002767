A Comparison of Simulation Event List Algorithms
Four algorithms are considered which can be used
to schedule events in a general purpose discrete 
simulation system.  Two of the algorithms are new, one
is based on an end-order tree structure for event 
notices, and another uses an indexed linear list. The algorithms
are tested with a set of typical stochastic 
scheduling distributions especially chosen to show
the advantages and limitations of the algorithms. 
 The end-order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous,
immediate replacement for the algorithm 
in use with current simulation languages.  The most
promising algorithm uses the indexed list concept. 
 It will require an adaptive routine before it can
be employed in general purpose simulators,but its 
performance is such that further study would be fruitful.
