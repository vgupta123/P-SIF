theory of supersonic propeller aerodynamics .
  a supersonic propeller with blades attached to an infinite
cylinder as a hub is studied .  the forward speed may be subsonic, but
the relative speed at each section is supersonic .  the lightly
loaded blades are represented by a surface distribution of
appropriate /modified/ sources in a fashion similar to ordinary
supersonic thin-wing theory .  these sources are found by
approximating the exact potential for a constant-strength
compressible source traveling along a helical path .  the usual
relationship between the source strength and boundary condition is
found,. and subsequently the source distribution is given, to the
appropriate order, in terms of the blade geometry .
  tip effects are considered by extending the theory of evvard
and krasilshchikova .  the present investigation, however, is
restricted to those planforms for which no vortex sheet appears
off the tip .  for points in the tip region, the potential is obtained
through the appropriate distribution of /modified/ sources in the
upwash region off the tip .  by transforming to a curvilinear,
nonorthogonal coordinate system coincident with the modified mach
lines described by the infinities of the potential, an integral
equation for the required source distribution in the upwash region is
derived .  without having to solve this equation, it is shown that
the potential for a point in the tip region can be obtained in terms
of an integration of known source distributions over the blade
surface only .
  the case of a twisted flat plate of particular planform is treated,
and a sample calculation is made of the pressure distribution at
selected radial positions within the noncommunicating portion
of the blade, as well as over the entire tip region .
  though this analysis is carried out explicitly for the supersonic
propeller, it could also be extended to calculate various rotary
derivatives for highspeed flight vehicles .
