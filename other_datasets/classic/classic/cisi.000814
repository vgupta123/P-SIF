Towards Automatic Profile Construction
  This paper describes part of the Chemical Abstracts Condensate
Evaluation (CAC Evaluation) carried out by the United Kingdom
Chemical Information Service (UKCIS).
  The work described was designed to test the feasibility of using
automatic or semi-automatic methods to replace or reduce the 
intellectual effort involved in retrieving information from machine
readable stores, particularly those using natural language.
