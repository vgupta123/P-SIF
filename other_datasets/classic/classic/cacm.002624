Formal Requirements for Virtualizable Third Generation Architectures
Virtual machine systems have been implemented
on a limited number of third generation computer 
systems, e.g. CP-67 on the IBM 360/67.  From previous
empirical studies, it is known that certain third 
generation computer systems, e.g. the DEC PDP-10, cannot
support a virtual machine system.  In this paper, 
model of a third-generation-like computer system is
developed.  Formal techniques are used to derive 
precise sufficient conditions to test whether such
an architecture can support virtual machines.
