Data Bases; Computers, and the Social Sciences
  This book was written with several diverse audiences in mind: (1)
social and behavioral scientists and their students, (2) librarians and
library-science students who are favorable about employing computers
and computer-usable information in their work and classes, and (3)
archivists and their employees who desire to have more than a current
overview of the problems and their tentative solutions.  Because of the
diversity of material, it is not expected that all readers will use the book
in the same way.  Rather, it is assumed that readers will supplement a
subset of the book with bibliographical materials from the reference
sections.
