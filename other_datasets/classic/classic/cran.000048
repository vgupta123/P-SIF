supersonic flow at the surface of a circular cone at
angle of attack .
  formulas for the inviscid flow properties on the surface of a
cone at angle of attack are derived for use in conjunction with
the m.i.t. cone tables .  these formulas are based upon an
entropy distribution on the cone surface which is uniform and
equal to that of the shocked fluid in the windward meridian
plane .  they predict values for the flow variables which may
differ significantly from the corresponding values obtained
directly from the cone tables .  the differences in the magnitudes
of the flow variables computed by the two methods tend to
increase with increasing free-stream mach number, cone angle
and angle of attack .
