The Disadvantaged and Library Effectiveness
    The report is concerned with the social utility of libraries and
with the factors that appear to be requirements for effective
programs.  In the absence of established standards or criteria for
measuring program effectiveness, we have substituted a comparative analysis of
a number of programs based on detailed observation of the program process;
a survey of needs and interests of the
target groups, both users and nonusers; and an assessment of the
library's role in the target neighborhood as it is perceived by other
community institutions serving the same groups.  Thus a basis for
comparisons and for judgements has been introduced which provides
a foundation for suggestions as to the direction in which programs
of service to the disadvantaged might move.
  To achieve the study objectives, library programs and practices
in low-income neighborhoods were examined in a number of cities.
In each of fifteen cities data were collected through interview and
observation in four subject areas: (1) the needs and interests of
the community residents, (2) library services in relation to other
available community resources, (3) the nature and scope of the
neighborhood library program and its relation to the rest of the
library system, and (4) available measures of the impact or
effectiveness of the program.
