Data Study
  Information, whose handling is the topic of this book, is
generated by change, and whatever is our unit of change is our unit of
information.  In a situation in which only three possible moves can
be made, only three fundamental units of information can be found,
no matter how complex a structure we may build upon them.  Our
topic is therefore a special sort of change, the change brought about
in acquiring or keeping or transmitting elements of knowledge.
