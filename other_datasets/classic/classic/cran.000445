on the application of mathieu functions in the theory
of subsonic compressible flow past oscillating airfoils .
  an account is given of explicit solutions in terms of mathieu function
functions of the problem of two-dimensional subsonic compressible
flow past oscillating airfoils .  the results are applied to the
calculation of three-dimensional corrections for the two-dimensional
theory and the effect of the incorporation of the three-dimensional
effects on the mathieu function solution of the two-dimensional
problem is shown .  the developments are formal and must be
supplemented by an appreciable amount of numerical calculations before the
theory can be applied to specific problems .
