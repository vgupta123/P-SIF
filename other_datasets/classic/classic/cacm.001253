QUIKSCRIPT-A SIMSCRIPT- Like Language for the G-20
QUIKSCRIPT is a simulation language based on
SIMSCRIPT and programmed entirely in an algebraic 
language, 20-GATE.  The QUIKSCRIPT language, its internal
implementation, and major differences between 
QUIKSCRIPT and SIMSCRIPT are presented.  This paper is
not a programming guide to the language, but rather 
an attempt to present its flavor.  A brief description of
SIMSCRIPT is included, as is a sufficient description 
of 20-GATE to render this material understandable
to the reader familiar with algebraic languages.
