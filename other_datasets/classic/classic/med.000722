bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexus
a rare case of bilateral papilloma of the choroid plexus
in a five-and-a-half-year old hydrocephalic girl is pre-
sented.
the tumor encountered at autopsy was not suspected
during life, the existing hydrocephalus being attributed
to either cytomegalic inclusion disease or toxoplasmosis.
after post mortem examination, it was evident that
the hydrocephalus was due to two factors; hypersecretion
from the tumor itself, and obstruction at the level of the
sylvian aqueduct by a delicate, tense, translucent mem-
brane.
an interesting and uncommon additional feature of
this case was the presence, within the choroidal papillo-
ma, of well-formed haversian bone.
a plea is made for regularly considering papilloma of
the choroid plexus in the differential diagnosis of hydro-
cephalus in children, for here, early diagnosis and treat-
ment might conceivably result in total cure.
