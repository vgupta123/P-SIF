Sorting with Large Volume, Random Access, Drum Storage
An approach to sorting records is described
using random access drum memory.  The Sort program 
described is designed to be a generalized, self-generating
sort, applicable to a variety of record statements. 
 This description is divided into three parts.  The
first part presents the operating environment; the 
second defines the general solution; the third part
describes the internal sort-merge technique.
