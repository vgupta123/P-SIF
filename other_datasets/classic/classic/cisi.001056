Metropolitan Public Library
  Public libraries in the 1960's which are active and alert and interested
in meeting the interests of their various publics face problems far
different from those of even a decade ago.  The Maryland metropolitan area
is an example of the many changes taking place in metropolitan areas
which require corresponding change in the type and form and arrangements for
library service and even demand looking into the very nature of library
service itself.
