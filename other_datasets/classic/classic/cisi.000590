Toward a Theory of Indexing--II
   The purpose of this paper is to present the elements of a basis for a
theory of information storage and retrieval.. It is believed that this theory
can best be formulated in terms of a general theory of indexing.. After stating
basic premises and defining essential concepts, the relationship between a 
theory of indexing and a theory of information storage and retrieval is 
considered.. The similarities between the indexing process and the general
communication process are discussed, and indexing is viewed as an order 
increasing (i.e., entropy decreasing) operation.. The concept of a theoretical
index is developed and contrasted with real-world indexing systems.. The
relationship between query formulation, retrieval, and benefit is discussed, 
and these notions are then related to the human performance variable.  It is 
believed that the ideas presented in this paper provide a useful framework 
for more detailed investigations into the indexing process..
