The Age of Jewett: Charles Coffin Jewett and American Librarianship
1841-1868
     Most librarians mark the beginning of modern librarianship
from the founding of the American Library Association in 1876 and
the appearance on the national library scene of such dynamic and
controversial figures as Melvil Dewey and Charles Ammi Cutter.
     But in doing so, they overlook an extremely significant era in
the history of our profession, for the quarter century preceding the
1876 meeting in Philadelphia was one characterized by great advances
in the field of American librarianship.  This period of growth was to
have considerable influence on the course of library development in
America after 1876.  To ignore the third quarter of the nineteenth
century is to risk misinterpreting the pivotal post-1876 era,
and in this time of reappraisal, it seems particularly appropriate
and useful to focus our attention on the years preceding the founding
of the American Library Association.
