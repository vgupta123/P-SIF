study of the oscillatory motion of manned vehicles
entering the earth's atmosphere .
  an analysis is made of the oscillatory
motion of vehicles which
traverse arbitrarily prescribed trajectories
through the atmosphere .
expressions for the oscillatory motion
are derived as continuous functions
of the properties of the trajectory .
  results are applied to a study of
the oscillatory behavior of re-entry
vehicles which have decelerations that
remain within limits of human
tolerance .  it is found that a deficiency of
aerodynamic damping for such
vehicles may have more serious consequences
than it does for comparable
ballistic missiles .
