User Experiences with Primary Journals on 16-Mm Microfilm
  The availability of scientific journals on 16-mm film is a relatively new
phenomenon.  User acceptance of this microfilm application has been greatly       
improved by loading the file into cartridges and making use of motor-driven
reader-printers.  This equipment permits rapid searching of the microfilm
and adds the convenience of on-the-spot hard-copy prints as needed.  Of prime  
importance are the economic advantages of these editions, since they allow many
special libraries to stretch greatly the space available to them for journal
housing.  The economics of this approach are also discussed, as are the 
reactions of the scientists and information personnel who use them.
