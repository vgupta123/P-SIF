Public Protection and Education with EFT
Research has revealed the existence of widespread
misinformation and lack of knowledge about EFT among
business and government as well as consumers.  As a result, any effort
to stimulate meaningful public participation in decisions on
the introduction of EFT systems will require a coordinated educational
effort of considerable scale.  In addition, research has revealed 
shortcomings in the present system for defining responsibilities,
liabilities, and avenues of recourse.  THis article presents
several possible alternatives for improving the current system, but
ongoing research is also needed to assure that actions taken will
be responsive to the changing environment and consumer needs.
