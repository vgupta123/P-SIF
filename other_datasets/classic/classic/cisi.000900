The Language Barrier; a study in depth of the place of foreign language
materials in the research activity of the academic community
This volume presents the results of a detailed study of the
place of foreign language materials in University research.
In the course of our investigation, we accumulated a large
amount of data on the use of published information and of
library services by research workers and academic staff.  Our
analyses have necessarily been limited by the specific aims of
the project, but we have been constantly aware that there are
many other possible analyses of the same material.  For this
reason we have endeavoured to include in the Appendix as much
of this "raw" data as possible and to provide in the text itself,
when presenting our own analyses, as much detail as possible of
the methodology and other background information necessary for
any full evaluation.
