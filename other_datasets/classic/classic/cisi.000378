Dialog Interactive Information Retrieval System
  DIALOG is the name given to an interactive, computer-based information
retrieval language developed at the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory.  
The DIALOG systems consists of a series of computer programs which have been
designed to make full use of direct access memory devices (in which data 
located anywhere on the device can be accessed in approximately the same amount
of time) and video display units to provide the user a rapid and powerful means
of identifying records within a file which satisfy the particular information
need.  By providing the user full display access to the indexing vocabulary,
and the ability to modify search expressions, DIALOG becomes a data processing
extension of the human operator who directs and controls the process according
to his own personal needs.
