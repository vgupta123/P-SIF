Word-Word Associations in Document Retrieval Systems
   The SMART automatic document retrieval system is used to study association 
procedures for automatic content analysis.. The effect of word frequency and 
other parameters on the association process is investigated through examination
of related pairs and through retrieval experiments.. Associated pairs of words
usually reflect localized word meanings, and true synonyms cannot readily be
found from first or second order relationships in our document collections.. 
There is little overlap between word relationships found through associations 
and those used in thesaurus construction, and the effects of word associations 
and a thesaurus in retrieval are independent.. The use of associations in 
retrieval experiments improves not only recall, by permitting new matches 
between requests and documents, but also precision, by reinforcing existing 
matches.. In our experiments, the precision effect is responsible for most of 
the improvement possible with associations.. A properly constructed thesaurus,
however, offers better performance than statistical association methods..
