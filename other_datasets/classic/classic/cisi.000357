Directory of Data Base in the Social and Behavioral Sciences
  As one of the early members of the computer community, I have
been keenly interested in the development of quantitative methodologies
in the social and behavioral sciences, and their encouragement
by the data processing environment.  The economists, with an already
established mathematical orientation, were among the earliest beneficiaries
of the machine technology that enhances their ability to
construct the test models of economic behavior.  Today, statistical
methods have so affected many disciplines that it is not unusual for
doctoral programs to accept statistical techniques as a substitute for
one foreign language.  Similarly, the ability to program in an
appropriate language is also frequently as acceptable as French or
German in providing the research skills needed by doctoral students at
The City University of New York and at other universities.
  The chief function of this directory, in terms of academic supplies
of data, is not to reinventory the social science data archives
that are well-known to the academic community, not to duplicate the
announcements of holdings that they themselves make available to their
members.  The reason for mentioning them and indicating the nature of
their holdings is to make this kind of data resource known to those
researchers, either in or out of the university, who are not sufficiently
aware of these important resources.
