similitude of hypersonic flows over slender bodies
in non-equilibrium dissociated gases .
  this paper is concerned with the similitude laws
governing inviscid, nonequilibrium gas flows
around blunt or sharp-nosed slender bodies at
zero angle of attack, based on the hypersonic
small disturbance flow theory .  some related
features of the interaction between the effects of
nose bluntness and nonequilibrium dissociation
and vibration and the influence of a
dissociated freestream are also discussed .  the
hypersonic equivalence principle and the related
similitude for affinely related bodies are set
forth for nonequilibrium flows in either diatomic
gases or a gas mixture such as air .  for a family
of diatomic gases, as opposed to a given gas
such as air, a generalized ambient gas state
scaling condition is obtained, whereby the
ambient density and temperature need not be
simulated .  a detailed discussion is given of
blunted cylinders and slabs or sharp-nosed
cones and wedges, including example
nonequilibrium flow field correlations of numerical
solutions available in the literature .  low density
nonequilibrium flows with a negligible shock
layer atom recombination rate are also
examined ,. as expected, a less restrictive small
disturbance similitude law is obtained in this
case .
