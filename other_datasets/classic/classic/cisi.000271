Determining and Allocating Book Funds for Current Domestic Buying
   A device is outlined to help formulate the annual book budget request..
Courses described in the college catalog are matched with the books listed in 
the American Book Publishing Record, BPR, Cumulative 1965.. Courses, treated
as if monographes, are designed Dewey classification numbers and arranged in 
decimal sequence by groups.. Books in BPR falling into the groups are tallied;
the DC groups are then rearranged by departments and the number and cost of 
books in each are totaled.. Results are sound estimates of each department's
probable current domestic book needs for that year and may be applied to the 
subsequent year as an estimate of what will probably be needed.. They may be 
used as factors in an allocation formula..
