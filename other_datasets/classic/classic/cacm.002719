Mechanical Program Analysis
One means of analyzing program performance
is by deriving closed-form expressions for their 
execution behavior.  This paper discusses the mechanization
of such analysis, and describes a system, 
Metric, which is able to analyze simple Lisp programs
and produce, for example, closed-form expressions
for their running time expressed in terms of size of input.
 This paper presents the reasons for mechanizing 
program analysis, describes the operation of Metric, explains
its implementation, and discusses its limitations.
