The Generation of a Unique Machine Description for Chemical Structures -
A Technique Developed at Chemical Abstracts Service
  As part of the development of a computer-based
chemical information system at CAS, it has been necessary
to devise techniques for the registration of drawings of
chemical structures.  A major purpose of the CAS registration
process is to determine whether a particular structure has
already been stored in the system.  The ability to make
this determination makes it possible to utilize a computer
to assign to every chemical structure a unique identifying
label.  This identifying label, referred to as a registry
number, is the thread that ties together all information
associated with a particular compound throughout the
developing CAS computer system.  It is because of this 
association, made possible by the registration process, that
CAS will be able to provide multiple-file correlative searches
with assurance that all information on file for a particular
compound has been located.
