Studies to Compare Retrieval Using Titles with that Using Index Terms.
SDI from 'Nuclear Science Abstracts'
   A Selective dissemination of Information service based on computer scanning
of Nuclear Science Abstracts tapes has operated at Harwell since October 1968..
Users' interest profiles are constructed using Euratom index terms and NSA 
subject categories assigned to each item in NSA..
   The performance of the mechanized SDI service has been compared with that of
the pre-existing current awareness service which is based on visual scanning of
journals and reports by information staff.. The visual service was found to be
providing an important service of good currency and high precision, about 85%, 
to a limited number of users.. the mechanized service is less selective and of 
lower precision, approximately 50%, but can be expanded more readily..
   In order to compare the effectiveness of Euratom index terms and words on 
titles for computer SDI matching, an experiment was set up in which sixty 
users of the mechanized service assessed NSA document notifications which were 
generated by matching either index terms and subject categories, or words in 
titles and subject categories, without being aware of the method of matching.. 
Over 10,000 document assessments, fron six issues of NSA were returned.. The 
average precision was 45.6% for index terms and 47.3% for title words.. Index 
terms retrieved more documents, in the ratio 1.13:1, but both systems missed 
many relevant documents retrieved by the other.. Index terms retrieved only 58% 
of the relevant documents selected by titles.. The converse ratio was 51%..
   No significant effects of document types or subject on the relative 
effectiveness of two matching systems were found, but when the results were 
analyzed by title length it appeared that for titles longer than about 100 
characters title words gave recall equal to that of index terms, though with a 
lower precision..
   A detailed study of samples of items found by visual scanning but missed by 
computer matching or found by one computer method but not by the other, was made
to identify reasons for failure..
