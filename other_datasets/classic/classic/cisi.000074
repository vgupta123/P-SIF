Managerial Cost Accounting for a Technical Information Center
   The purpose of this paper is to describe a research project conducted at a 
technical center to test the hypothesis that: A theoretically-sound managerial 
cost-accounting system can be designed to meet the specific characteristics of 
a technical information center by revising and innovating systems utilized by 
other enterprises.. A computerized cost system was developed and operated for
a three-month period to test this hypothesis.. The results of the study 
indicate that effective managerial cost accounting is possible for a technical
information center.. Relevant cost information was generated periodically to 
measure the operating performance of the center's production process.. A 
summary of the data that were reported regularly to management is presented 
in this paper..
