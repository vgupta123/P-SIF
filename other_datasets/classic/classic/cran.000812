investigation of two bluff shapes in axial free flight
over a mach number range from 0. 35 to 2. 15 .
  a fineness-ratio-2.71 right circular cylinder and a fineness-
ratio-been tested in free flight over a mach number range of 0.35 to 2.15 and
a reynolds number range of 1 x 10 to 12 x 10 .  time histories, cross
plots of force coefficients, rolling velocity, and longitudinal-force
coefficient are presented for both cylinders .  in addition, cross plots
of moment coefficients and plots of the normal-force curve slope and
the aerodynamic center are presented for the fineness-ratio-2.71
cylinder .  the average aerodynamic center of the right circular
cylinder moved rearward with decreasing speeds until at the subsonic
mach numbers it remained approximately constant and comparisons of the
drag data of this test with wind tunnel and other free-flight data show
good agreement .  an appreciable decrease in drag was observed when the
data of the present test of the rounded nose cylinder were compared with
data of a right circular cylinder of a similar configuration .
