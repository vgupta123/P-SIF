The Automatic Creation of Literature Abstracts
   Experts of technical papers and magazine articles that serve the purposes of
conventional abstracts have been created entirely by automatic means.. In the
exploratory research described, the complete text of an article in machine-
readable form is scanned by an IBM 704 data-processing machine and analyzed 
in accordance with a standard program..  Statistical information derived from 
word frequency and distribution is used by the machine to compute a relative 
measure of significance, first for individual words and then for sentences..
Sentences scoring highest in significance are extracted and printed out to 
become the "auto-abstract"..
