Techniques for the Simulation of Computer Logic
The simulation of a digital computer is an
integral part of most computer design automation 
systems.  The evaluation of the Boolean functions which
characterize the computer being simulated constitutes 
one major portion of a simulation system.  Four general
procedural classes for evaluating these functions 
are defined.  Toward greatly increased efficiency of a simulation
system, methods are presented for simultaneously 
evaluating many functions for one set of values of the
variables,and for evaluating simultaneously one 
function for many sets of values for the variables.
