The Structure of Programming Languages
In this paper the major components of every
programming language are identified as: (1) the 
elementary program statement, (2) mechanisms for linking
elementary statements together, (3) the means 
by which a program can obtain data inputs.  Several
alternative forms of each of these components are 
also described, compared and evaluated.  Many examples,
frequently from list processing languages, illustrate 
the forms described.  The advantages, disadvantages and
factors influencing the choice of a form of component 
for a language are discussed, and the paper concludes
with the suggestion that programming languages 
evolve toward one which will permit all the most convenient
ways of structuring programs, organizing 
systems and referencing data.
