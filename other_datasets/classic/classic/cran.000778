an integral related to the radiation integrals .
  the author points out the relation of the integral
to problems in astrophysics and quantum mechanics, and
because of its importance supplies a table of values .  the
table gives rl(x) to seven places of decimals from x=0 to
x=6.00 at intervals of 0.01 .  second order central differences
are tabulated to assist in interpolation .
