Scientific Information by Computer
   An evaluation of the Chemical Society's Chemical Titles information
retrieval service compared with a parallel manual search of the literature
has shown that, at least in certain disciplines, more than 90 per cent of the
desired information can be obtained..  This is quite adequate for most
commercial and scientific purposes..
