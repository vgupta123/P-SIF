Mechanization of Library Procedures in the Medium-sized Medical Library
  Mechanical means for expediting library work have been considered
for many years, as an examination of the early pages of Library
Journals bears out. The very first volume of the forerunner of the Bulletin,
the Medical Library and Historical Journal, moreover, contained an
article on the use of the "typewriting machine" in cataloging.  Telephones
have long been accepted as library machines, and, except for unusual
items, hand bookbinding has given way to machine-bound books.
  Nevertheless, when the term "machine methods" is used for libraries
today, the prevailing idea is that expensive and complicated electronic
equipment must be employed, and, since few libraries are able to afford
such equipment for themselves, it is generally assumed that none but the
largest libraries (the Library of Congress or the National Library of
Medicine, for example) will be able to employ already existing mechanical
methods or devise systems specifically applicable to their own situations.
