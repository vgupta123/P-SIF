a theory of transonic aileron buzz, neglecting viscous
effects .
  usaf-sponsored analysis of the unsteady perturbations of
two-dimensional transonic flow around an airfoil, where local supersonic
regions terminated by shock waves are present in the vicinity of the
airfoil .  viscous effects are neglected, and a linearized theory of
the perturbations due to harmonic oscillations of an aileron is
developed .  a series solution for the pressure distribution is obtained,
and numerical results for the nonsteady hinge moment, from the
first approximation to the solution, are presented .  as a result of
flutter analysis a stability boundary for transonic aileron buzz is
obtained .  comparison of the theoretical results with experimental
observations shows satisfactory agreement .
