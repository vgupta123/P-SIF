The Implementation, Evaluation, and Refinement of a Manual SDI Service 
   The Missouri Institute of Psychiatry Library has implemented an inexpensive,
manual SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) service based upon the 
monthly issues of Index Medicus.. The implementation and refinement of the 
system are documented, and the very favorable response to the system is 
examined.. The SDI service is compared to Current Contents, with the finding
that 60 percent of the SDI participants prefer it to Current Contents.. For
this select portion of researchers the Index Medicus SDI is the more suitable
mode of current awareness.. For a significant portion of the MIP staff, 
however, the score of Index Medicus is too restricted to suitable replace 
Current Contents.. All SDI users find it highly acceptable curent awareness 
service for use in addition to Current Contents and have indicated the desire 
to continue participation in the service..
