vorticity interaction at an axisymmetric stagnation
point in a viscous incompressible fluid .
  the purpose of the present note is to give an exact solution of
the incompressible navier-stokes equations at an axisymmetric
stagnation point with vorticity in the oncoming flow which varies
linearly with distance from the axis .  this solution has application
to the hypersonic axisymmetric blunt body problem, for which
lighthill has shown the vorticity in the inviscid shock layer is
very nearly of this form .
