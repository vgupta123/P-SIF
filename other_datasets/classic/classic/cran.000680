generalized conical flow fields in supersonic wing theory .
linearized, compressible-flow analysis is applied to the study of
quasi-conical supersonic wing theory . single-integral equations are
derived which relate either the loading to the shape of a lifting
surface or the thickness of a symmetrical wing to the pressure
distribution for triangular wings with subsonic leading edges . the forms of
these equations and their inversions are simplified through the
introduction of the finite part and the generalized principal part of an
integral .
applications of the theory, in the lifting case, include previously
known results . in the nonlifting case, it is shown that for a specified
 pressure distribution the theory does not always predict a unique
thickness distribution . this is demonstrated for a triangular plan form
 having a constant pressure gradient in the stream direction .
