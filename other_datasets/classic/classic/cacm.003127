Thoth, a Portable Real-Time Operating System 
Thoth isa real-time operating system which is designed to be portable
over a large set of machines.  It is currently running on two minicomputers
with quite different architectures.  Both the system and application
programs which use it are written in a high-level language.
Because the system is implemented by the same software on different
hardware, it has the same interface to user programs.  Hence,
application programs which use Thoth are  highly portable.  Thoth
encourages structuring programs as networks of communicating processes 
by providing efficient interprocess communication primitives.
