Integral Equations of Immunology
The inversion of a particular integral equation
of the first (Fredholm) kind is the basic problem 
considered.  The strategy which yielded success consisted
of three essential points: (1) fit the known 
experimental data by a curve with properties which derive
from properties of the (as yet unknown) function; 
(2) stabilize the computation for the unknown function
by using singular value decomposition; (3) constrain 
the unknown function approximation (since it represents
a probability distribution) to be nonnegative. 
 A number of test cases are presented. One set of actual
experimental data is analyzed with the procedures 
presented.
