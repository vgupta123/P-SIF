Pitch Period Determination of Speech Sounds
A computer procedure which determines pitch
periods by the recognition of the peak structure 
of the speech waveform is described.  Speech sounds were
sampled by a microphone and an analog-to-digital 
converter attached to an interconnected IBM 7090-PDP-1
system.  These utterances were recorded at the 
normal noise level of the computer room but were not
band-compressed or phase-distorted in any manner. 
 A sequence of operations defined on the speech wave selects
a list of points along the waveform as candidates 
for pitch markers.  These markers are validated by
an error detection and correction procedure.About 
95 percent of the pitch periods were recognized correctly
within 1 to 2 times real-time on the IBM 7090.
