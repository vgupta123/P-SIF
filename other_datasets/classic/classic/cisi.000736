Overview of the NAS/NRC Conference on Large Data Bases
  In 1971 the Committee on Chemical Information of the
National Academy of Sciences, National Research Council,
recognized the problem of large data bases and accordingly
created a subcommittee to investigate the problem and its
impact on chemical information.
  The first task of the Large Data Base Subcommittee was
to survey organizations that generate and/or process large
data bases.  Giering has indicated several different ways in
which one can view a data base as being large.  It can be
large in terms of having a large number of entries or
records (or bibliographic references).  It can be large in
the sense of having a large number of fields or data
elements, which implies a degree of complexity.  It can be
thought of as large in the sense of having a large number
of searchable or selectable elements, and it also can be
large in the most readily understandable sense of having
a large number of characters in storage.
