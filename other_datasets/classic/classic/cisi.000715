Articulation in the Generation of Subject Indexes by computer
  A simple and logical model for the automatic generation of subject indexes
from title like phrases is described, and its advantages and disadvantages
are discussed.	It is based on recent studies of the structure of articulated
subject indexes, such as those to Chemical Abstracts.  The model employs the
prepositions and connectives of phrases of simple structure as articulating
points, and selects from all possible forms of entries those which lead to
optimal organization in an index.  The technique is illustrated with part of an
index to a recent abstracting journal.  The wide variety of
controls which can be exerted by the indexer and the program is discussed.
