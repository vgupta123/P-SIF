on heat transfer over a sweat-cooled surface in laminar
compressible flow with a pressure gradient .
  a simple expression is derived for the normal injection velocity
distribution theoretically required to maintain a given uniform
temperature along a porous surface in the laminar
boundary-layer region of a compressible flow with a given velocity
distribution outside of the boundary layer .  this expression is valid for
any given free-stream mach number but is based on a prandtl
number of unity and on the assumption that the viscosity
coefficient varies linearly with the temperature .  by using the
dorodnitsyn type of transformation, the variation of fluid
properties even in the case of zero mach number is taken into
account .  this study is of particular practical interest in
connection with the sweat-cooling of turbine blades and of airfoil surfaces
in high speed flow .  the method of analysis consists of applying
the karman-pohlhausen method to both the momentum and
energy boundary-layer equations and of using an additional heat
balance equation, involving the coolant temperature .  a
closed-form approximate solution of the equations is then derived .
numerical examples for flow in the immediate vicinity of a
stagnation point and for a typical type of flow over a turbine blade are
given .
