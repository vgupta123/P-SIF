State of the Nation in Networking
    There is little so ephemeral as a "Current review" in an area so rapidly
changing as library networking.  Yet this very characteristic of rapid change
makes valid the effort of providing an overview at a point in time.
    The first task, then, is network definition and description, necessary
because a large number of library activities have been described as "networks"
and only a limited number are covered here.  The chapter on "Library and
Information Networks" in volume seven of the Annual Review of Information
Science and Technology provides a "normative list" of "essential 
characteristics":
    1. A network's function is to marshal resources ... to accomplish results
       beyond the ability of any one of its members.
    2. A network has developed an organizational design and structure that
       allows it to establish an identifiable domain....
    3. It has a base in communications technology.
