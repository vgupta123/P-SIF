Interrelationships of Scientific Journals
   A series of models of the interrelationship of scientific journals
has been developed from the cross citing amongst 275 journals in
mathematics, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and biology..    
The data source was the Journal Citation Index (JCI), a file derived
from the Science Citation Index.. The JCI consists of a journal by
journal tabulation of citings to and from each journal in the index..
A large amount of consistency was found between the citing characteristics
of the journals in the different scientific fields, with quite clear
boundaries between fields and a few well known cross disciplinary
journals as cross field information links..
The separate disciplines appear to relate to each other in an orderly
manner, with a natural sequence:  mathematics --> physics --> chemistry -->
biochemistry --> biology.. Within disciplines the journals form fully
transitive hierarchies with very few relational conflicts..
