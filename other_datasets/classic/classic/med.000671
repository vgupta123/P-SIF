effects of adrenalectomy on
the parathyroids in nephrectomized rats
rat parathyroids were studied both after nephrectomy and after com-
bined nephrectomy and adrenalectomy.  as early as 24 hours after
nephrectomy there were morphological indications of increased para-
thyroid activity in the form of increased glandular volume and enlarged
cell nuclei.  the corresponding changes after combined nephrectomy and
adrenalectomy were less marked and the total serum calcium was higher
than after nephrectomy only.  these observations suggest that the adrenals
could induce a change in calcium homeostasis opposite to that of the
parathyroids.
