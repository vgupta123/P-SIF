Making On-Line Search Available in an Industrial Research Environment
   On-line interactive searching of several information bases through several
service operators was introduced in an industrial research environment.. 
Thorough knowledge of the information base and its structure in the search
system is a major factor of successful searching, and differences among search
systems do not present serious barriers.. This new technique was most 
effectively used when the information specialist and the scientist searched as
a team.. On-line searching is now an established search tool at Exxon Research
and Engineering Company..
