Fair (Fast Access Information Retrieval) Project; 
Aims and Methods
  I am going to describe in general terms a research project
which has been established to explore some of the problems of
the use of the literature, particularly in the field of
Biomedical Engineering of the National Institute for Medical
Research (Hampstead Laboratories).  The project is scheduled
to last for three years, and like most research, consists of
a number of overlapping stages.  We have reached the stage now
of having acquired sufficient equipment and data to start trying
out some of our ideas.
