haemophilia in sweden
vii. incidence, treatment and prophylaxis of
arthropathy and other musculo-skeletal
manifestations of haemophilia a and b
the clinical material consisted of 242 of the 308 known haemophiliacs
(a and b) in sweden.  the investigation included clinical examination of
all major joints in 95 of 116 patients with severe haemophilia, in 38 of
65 patients with moderate haemophilia, and in 24 of 127 patients with
mild haemophilia, and roentgen examination of practically all joints
found to be abnormal at the clinical examination.  in addition information
about 7 patients with severe haemophilia, 21 with moderate haemophilia,
and 57 with mild haemophilia was obtained by questionnaire only.
the degree of arthropathy (grades 2, 3 and 4) was classified largely
according to depalma and cotler (1956).  evaluation of general disability
was made with regard to ability to manage (walk, dress, eat, toilet) with-
out help.  this latter evaluation comprised also extra-articular manifesta-
tions of haemophilia.
