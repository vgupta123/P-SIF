AIM-TWX service at the University of Virginia:
       A Review and Evaluation
   The paper reviews the highlights of a four-week trial period (November 19 -
December 18, 1970) during which the Medical Library of the University of
Virginia experimented with a new remote-access bibliographical control and
retrieval system via its TWX machine.. The system, called AIM-TWX, was
sponsored by the Lister Hill National Center for Biomedical Communications
and utilized a time-shared IBM 360/67 computer in Santa Monica, California..
Citations from 109 clinically-oriented  journals from 1966 to date, including
those currently included in the Abridged Index Medicus, may be retrieved
either on- or off-line..
   Various aspects of this service are described, including problems of
staffing, training, and record keeping, as well as the role of the MeSH
vocabulary which is the principle "language" of the man-computer dialog..
   The statistical results indicated that the system was used for approximately
200 minuted on nineteen days and that an average of sixteen searches were run
on any given day, or about 4.6 searches per hour of use.. In spite of an 
inexperienced staff who had little knowledge of the MeSH vocabulary and whose
training schedule was limited to one four-hour session, the experiment was
highly successful in terms of searches and citations..
   At the end of the period, 298 searches had been run for 114 requestors,
and  5,343 citations had been produced.. Only fifty-five searches yielded no 
citations.. The experiment generated a great deal of excitement and interest
among the staff of the Library and of the Medical Center.. Moreover, a large
number of medical practitioners in large and small communities  of Virginia
participated in this experiment, indicating that there exists a great demand
for this type of literature searching which AIM-TWX is able to provide with
great rapidity..
