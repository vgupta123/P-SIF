Information Flow in Research and Development Laboratories
   Technical communication patterns in two research and development laboratories
were examined using modified sociometric techniques.. The structure of 
technical communication networks in the two laboratories results from the 
interaction of both social relations and work structure.. The sociometric 
"stars" in the technical communication network who provide other members of the
organization with information either make greater use of individuals outside
the organization or read the literature more than other members of the 
laboratory..
