numerical comparison between exact and approximate
theories of hypersonic inviscid flow past slender blunt
nosed bodies .
  this paper presents numerical results of
exact calculations of the inviscid equilibrium flow about
a long hemisphere-cylinder in motion
at hypersonic velocity .  a comparison is made with blast
wave as well as free layer theories of hypersonic
flow .  as a result of the comparison, it is concluded
that the second-order blast wave theory can
be used for the purpose of finding the shock shape and
the body pressure distribution .  however,
this procedure is definitely empirical and cannot be
justified on rational or theoretical grounds .
we show that the presently calculated radial distribution
of energy is radically different than that
given by blast wave theory .  if body shapes other than
those considered here are of interest, the
only reliable approach at the present time is to carry out
numerical calculations .  it was found
that for certain flight velocities the pressure on the body
does not decay to free stream pressure
monotonically but overexpands .
