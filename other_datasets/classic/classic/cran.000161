supersonic flow past a family of blunt symmetric bodies .
  some 100 numerical computations have been
carried out for unyawed bodies of revolution with
detached bow waves .  the gas is assumed perfect
with .  free-stream mach numbers
are taken as 1.2, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 10, and .  the
results are summarized with emphasis on the sphere
and paraboloid .
