the original paper gave a correlation formula for stagnation point heat
transfer rate to a blunt body of revolution in hypersonic flow . this
note gives a somewhat refined version, based on further calculation and
shock tube data . its effect on the conclusions of the original paper is
 negligible except at surface temperature parameters of over 5000
r-ft1/8 . in other problems, where heat transfer rate itself is
important, it can make a significant defference .
