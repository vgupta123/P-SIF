aerodynamic noise in supersonic wind tunnels .
hot-wire measurements in the free stream of a supersonic wind tunnel
were made in the mach number range of 1.6 to 5.0 . it is shown that the
mass-flow fluctuations increase very rapidly with increasing mach
number . if the fluctuation field is assumed to consist of sound waves-dash
an assumption that is consistent with the measurements-dashthe sound
intensity is approximately proportional to m, within the range of the
experiments . furthermore, the orientation of the field is found to be
different from the mach line direction,. it corresponds to a
sound-source velocity of approximately one-half the free-stream velocity for
the higher mach numbers . it is shown that the turbulent boundary layer
along the nozzle and the tunnel walls is responsible for this sound
field .
