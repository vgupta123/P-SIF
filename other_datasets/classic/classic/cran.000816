experimental investigation at a mach number of 3. 11
of the lift, drag and pitching moment characteristics
of a number of blunt low-fineness-ratio bodies .
  a number of blunt bodies having shapes that may be suitable for
atmospheric reentry were tested to determine the lift, drag, and
pitching-moment characteristics at a mach number of 3.11 and a reynolds
number of 6 x 10 based on maximum body diameter of 2 inches .
  the results of the tests showed that all the bodies were statically
stable about a point located one-third of the body length from the
nose .  the results also showed that high-drag bodies which have a large
portion of their afterbodies negatively sloped (decrease in
cross-sectional area from nose to base) may have a negative lift-curve slope .
this negative slope results from the large negative lift component of
the axial force obtained with those bodies and the fact that with
negatively sloped afterbodies only small normal forces are developed .
