On Some Clustering Techniques
   The problem of organizing a large mass of data occurs frequently in 
research.. Normally, some process of generalization is used to compress the 
data so that it can be analyzed more easily.. A primitive step in this process 
is the "clustering" technique, which involves gathering together similar data 
into a cluster to permit a significant generalization..
   This paper describes a number of methods which make use of IBM 7090 computer
programs to do clustering.. A medical research problem is used to illustrate
and compare these methods..
