Library Education and the Public Library
  A major and largely justifiable criticism of library education has always
been that it is too closely tied to present practices and that it trains
for current service instead of educating for growth and change.  Unfortunately,
the picture many faculty members have of what today's
requirements for public library service are tends to be obsolete.  Graduates 
are thus doubly handicapped.  Not only do we fail to educate, we fail
even to provide realistic training.  At worst, we perpetuate the past and
train people for tasks that are no longer central to the concerns of public
libraries.   Library education, like the public
library itself, will have to accelerate the pace of change or risk the fate of
oblivion.  Institutions that can move with the times and maintain a position
of relevance to contemporary affairs will survive.  Others will wither
away, disappear, or be replaced by more responsive agencies.  There is no
shortage of prophets of doom for both the public library and for
graduate library education, but there are plenty of signs of life yet in both.
An article in the June 13, 1968 issue of The Reporter called "Dust Gathers
on the Public Library" summed up nicely the apparent slow decline and
loss of purpose of a once-revered institution (however, The Reporter is
dead - while the public library lives on).
