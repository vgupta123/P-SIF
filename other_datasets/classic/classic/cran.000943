compressible free shear layer with finite initial thickness .
  the momentum equation was uncoupled from
the other conservation equations for the case
of a finite initial profile in a laminar free shear layer .
the equation was solved numerically, in
the crocco coordinate system, using an implicit
finite difference method .  profiles of velocity
and shear function were obtained as a function of
streamwise distance .  the initial profiles as
the flow separates from the rear of the body
correspond to the blasius profile in transformed
coordinates .  for large distances downstream,
the profiles approach the chapman
distribution, corresponding to the case of zero initial
free shear layer thickness .  the effect of these
results on calculations of base pressure and wake
angle is discussed .  a method for the
calculation of finite chemical kinetic effects on the
profiles of temperature and chemical
composition in the free shear layer with finite initial
thickness is outlined .
