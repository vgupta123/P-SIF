Patterns of Evaluation in Science:
Institutionalization, Structure and
Functions of the Referee System
  The referee system in science involves the systematic use of judges to
assess the acceptability of manuscripts submitted for publication.  The
referee is thus an example of status-judges who are charged with evaluating
the quality of role-performance in a social system.  They are found in
every institutional sphere.  Other kinds of status-judges include teachers
assessing the quality of work by students (and, as a recent institutional
change, students officially assessing the quality of performance by teachers),
critics in the arts, supervisors in industry and coaches and managers in
sports.  Status-judges are integral to any system of social control through
their evaluation of role-performance and their allocation of rewards for
that performance.  They influence the motivation to maintain or to raise
standards of performance.
