aeroelastic problems in connection with high speed
flight .
  a review is given of developments
in the field of aeroelasticity during the
past ten years .  the effect of steadily increasing
mach number has been two-fold ..  on
the one hand the aerodynamic derivatives have
changed, and in some cases brought new
problems, and on the other hand the design for
higher mach numbers has led to thinner
aerofoils and more slender fuselages for which
the required stiffness is more difficult to
provide .  both these aspects are discussed,
and various methods of attack on the
problems are considered .  the relative merits
of stiffness, damping and massbalance
for the prevention of control surface flutter are
discussed .  a brief mention is made of
the recent problems of damage from jet efflux
and of the possible aeroelastic effects
of kinetic heating .
