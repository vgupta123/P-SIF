Experience with the Mechanized Chemical and Biological 
Information Retrieval System
  New computer methods have been developed in associations with the drug
development programs of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.  Experiences
with these systems are recounted.  Special input devices and computer 
programming have been developed for the input and retrieval of conventional
chemical structural diagrams.  The costs, operation, and the advantages of this
system are discussed.  Associated files of biological properties and inventory
control information have been created, which are searchable.  The methods used
in creating consolidated listings of selected chemical compounds and associated
biological data are discussed.
