A Fast Algorithm for Copying List Structures
An algorithm is presented for copying an arbitrarily
linked list structure into a block of 
contiguous storage locations without destroying  the original
list.  Apart from a fixed number of program 
variables, no auxiliary storage, such as a stack, is used.
 The algorithm needs no mark bits and operates 
in linear time.  It is shown to be significantly faster
than Fisher's algorithm, the fastest previous 
linear-time algorithm for the same problem.  Its speed
comes mainly from its efficient list-traversal 
technique, which folds the processing stack into the
structure being built, and from its classification 
of list cells into nine types, which enables processing
operations to be optimized for each type.
