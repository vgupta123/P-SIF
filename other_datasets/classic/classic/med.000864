sudden hypocalcemia in normal and hypoparathyroid subjects.
   serum calcium concentration was suddenly decreased
in 10 normal and 4 hypoparathyroid subjects
by the infusion of 50 mg/kg of disodium edta over a
30- to 45-minute interval.  the return rate to pre-infusion
values of the serum calcium concentration was the
same in both groups.  serum phosphate showed a marked,
transient decrease 30 min after the infusion in normal
individuals, but not in those with hypoparathyroidism.
the hypophosphatemia was followed by a marked
increase in phosphate clearance in the normal group and
a decrease in the hypoparathyroid group.  urine phosphate:
urine creatinine x 10 (up:uc x 10) and urine
phosphate: urine osmolality x 10 (up:uo x 10) ratios
also reflected an increased phosphate excretion in the
2 groups.  a simple clinical measure of parathyroid
function is suggested by determining the up:uo x 10
or the up:uc x 10, or both, ratios before and 3 to 6
hr after intravenous infusion of disodium edta.
