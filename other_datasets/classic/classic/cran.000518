heat conduction through a polyatomic gas .
  a heat conduction problem is set up
which, in essence, simulates the conditions
arising when a plane shock wave reflects
from a co-planar solid boundary .  the gas
is assumed to be polyatomic, with one
  the quantity of primary interest is
the temperature of the solid at the interface,
since this can be observed experimentally
without much difficulty .  solutions are
obtained for this quantity which cover a
range of practically plausible relaxation times
and 'wall effect' parameters .  it is essential
to include proper temperature jump
boundary conditions for both active and
relaxing (or inert) energy modes .  thus it is
necessary to know accommodation coefficients
for these modes of energy storage .
the temperature jump effects are found to
dominate the (interface) solid's temperature
time history, with relaxation effects playing
a very secondary role .
  the theoretical results are compared
with some experimental observations and
encouraging agreement is found .  as a
result of this agreement it proves possible to
estimate the accommodation coefficient
for the active modes (in this case for the
combination platinum air), the pressure
being about 15 atmospheres .  the pressure
sensitivity of accommodation effects is commented on .
