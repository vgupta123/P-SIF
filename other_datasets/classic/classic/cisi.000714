Weighted Term Search: A Computer Program for an Inverted Coordinate Index
on Magnetic Tape
   Ten to 15 years ago, much technical literature was accurately indexed 
according to strict rules of classification.. Today, because of the large
amount of technical data written, it is no longer practical to apply the same
rigid indexing procedures.. We should therefore be concerned with new search 
techniques which will allow us to handle input at the lower level we are forced 
to accept.. This paper describes such a search technique..
