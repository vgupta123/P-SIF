the influence of thyroid hormone on renal function during the course
of compensatory hypertrophy.
during the course of compensatory hypertrophy
of the kidney, glomerular filtration
and renal plasma flow increased to a less
extent in thyroidectomized animals than
in control animals.  the secretory capacity
of the renal tubules of thyroidectomized
animals increased insignificantly during
compensatory hypertrophy, but increased
markedly after administration of thyroid hormone.
