acid catabolic enzyme activity in relation
to accessory limb and cancer initiation in amphibia
cathepsin and acid phosphatase were determined in livers and kidneys
of adult rana pipiens and triturus viridescens.  organ-specific and species-
specific differences in distribution of these enzymes were found, as well as
considerable differences in the effect triton x-100 on the two enzymes.
a heterogeneous population of lysosomes in respect to enzyme content and
stability is deduced.
we have found positive correlations between catheptic activity of the
implant and host tissue dissociation, and between acid phosphatase and
inducibility, as features of the phenomenon of implant-induced accessory
limb formation in urodeles.  further, we have found a positive correlation
between catheptic activity and resistance to virus-induced renal adenocar-
cinoma development in rana pipiens.
