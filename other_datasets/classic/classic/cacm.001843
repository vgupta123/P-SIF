The Choice of Base
A digital computer is considered, whose memory
words are composed on N r-state devices plus 
two sign bits (two state devices).  The choice of base
B for the internal representation of floating-point 
numbers on such a computer is discussed.  It is
shown that in a certain sense B= r is best.
