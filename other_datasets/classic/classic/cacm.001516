Automatic Data Compression
The "information explosion" noted in recent
years makes it essential that storage requirements 
for all information be kept to a minimum.  A fully automatic
and rapid three-part compressor which can 
be used with "any" body of information to greatly reduce
slow external storage requirements and to increase 
the rate of information transmission through a computer
is described in this paper.  The system will 
also automatically decode the compressed information
on an item-by-item basis when it is required.  The 
three component compressors, which can be used separately
to accomplish their specific tasks, are discussed: 
NUPAK for the automatic compression of numerical data, ANPAK
for the automatic compression of "any" information, 
and IOPAK for further compression of information to be stored on tape or cards.
