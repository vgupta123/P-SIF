aerodynamic characteristics of a circular cylinder
at mach number of 6. 86 and angles of attack up to
90 .
  pressure-distribution and force
tests of a circular cylinder have
been made in the langley 11-inch
hypersonic tunnel at a mach number of
based on diameter, and angles of
attack up to 90 .  the results are
compared with the hypersonic
approximation of grimminger, williams, and
young and with a simple modification
of the newtonian flow theory .  the
comparison of experimental results
shows that either theory gives adequate
general aerodynamic
characteristics but that the modified newtonian
theory gives a more accurate
prediction of the pressure distribution .
the calculated crossflow drag
coefficients plotted as a function
of crossflow mach number were found
to be in reasonable agreement with
similar results obtained from other
investigations at lower supersonic
mach numbers .  comparison of the
results of this investigation with
data obtained at a lower mach number
indicates that the drag coefficient
of a cylinder normal to the flow is
relatively constant for mach numbers
above about 4 .
