Subject Specialisation in Academic Libraries:
some preliminary observations on role conflict and organizational stress
  The library of the University of East Anglia has been organized on the basis
of subject specialization, a system which the author believes to be applicable
to small and medium-sized universities.  A comparison of university structure
and university library structure shows how the system can bring about
organizational strains and conflict situations in respect of career patterns
of senior staff members.  The need to recognize academic considerations for
library promotions is stressed and a case made out for the fullest involvement
of all senior library staff in policy-making.
