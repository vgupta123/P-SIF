The Scholar and the Future of the Research Library
  Of all the problems which have, of recent years,
engaged the attention of educators and librarians
none have been more puzzling than those posed by
the astonishing growth of our great research 
libraries.  My own interest in this subject has, 
over several years, resulted in a series of papers,
some of them mainly analyzes, but others of them
endeavoring to suggest answers to what has 
sometimes seemed to be an almost insoluble puzzle.
