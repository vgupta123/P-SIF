Data Directed Input-Output in FORTRAN
A statement which is similar to the NAMELIST
statement of FORTRAN IV has been incorporated 
in the FORTRAN 63 compiler.  The FORTRAN 63 implementation
allows a greater flexibility and simplicity 
than the FORTRAN IV feature.  The Hollerith names, the
location, the mode and the dimensions of a variable 
can be discovered by means of standard FORTRAN statements.
 Methods of using this information are illustrated 
in relation to general purpose data directed input and
output routines; some other uses such as matrix 
manipulation are discussed.
