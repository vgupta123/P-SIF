the blasius equation with three-point boundary conditions .
the blasius equation subject to three-point boundary conditions,
describing the interaction between two parallel streams, is solved by way
of a series in terms of ascending powers of the ratio equals /u1 -dash
u2//u1, where the u1's are the outer streams' velocities .
the first three terms of the series are analytically expressed in terms
of the repeated integrals of the complementary error function /im erfc /
and of the repeated integrals of the square of the successive integrals
of the complementary error function /jmin erfc n/ . these functions
often appear in problems leading to extended heat-conduction type of
equations . a recurrence formula for jmin erfc n is established and
formulae relating the functions in erfc /-dashn/ and jmjn erfc to
available tabulated values of the functions in erfc /n/ are derived .
the first three approximations to the blasius function and to its first
two derivatives are also presented in tabulated form with four
significant figures . test on the convergence of the series has been made by
comparison with some exact solutions obtained by high speed computing
machine . the comparison, extended to the physically essential
quantities, shows that ..
second and first derivatives .
yield extremely accurate results . the errors in the first two
derivatives of the blasius functions are always contained within less than one
 per cent .
