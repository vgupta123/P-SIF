A Strategic Planning Methodology for the Computing
Effort in Higher Education: An Empirical Evaluation
The findings of a study designed to address
the pressing problems associated with the strategic 
planning of the computing effort in higher education
are presented here.  A planning methodology was 
developed and tested through implementation at a university.
 Two years after the methodology was implemented, 
the effectiveness of the planning methodology was assessed
in terms of the improvement of the delivery 
of computing services to the major institutional roles
of instruction, research, and administration. 
 Two control institutions were employed to contrast the
improvements at the test institution.  The results 
of the research indicate the planning methodology significantly
enhanced the delivery of computing services.
