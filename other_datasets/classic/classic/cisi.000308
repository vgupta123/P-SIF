The Coming Crisis of Western Sociology
  The criticism and transformation of society can be divorced only
at our peril from the criticism and transformation of theories about
society.  Yet the gap between theory and practice, so common in the
history of American radical movements, is in some quarters growing
wider.  Some of the most militant of American radicals, in the
New Left or in the movement for Black liberation, have at least
temporarily avoided any serious concern with social theory.
  This neglect of theory doubtless has various origins.  In some
part it is due to the fact that these social movements are still new
and their political activism consumes their necessarily limited
energies and resources; the new radicalisms will, in short, need time
to produce their new theories.  Although the neglect of theory is
scarcely peculiar to Americans, it is in part also due to the fact
that American radicals are often more American than they know and
may prefer the tangible outcomes of pragmatic politics to the
intangible outputs of theory.  Again, part of their neglect of theoretical
problems is probably due to the close links that some young radicals
have with the "hippie" contingent of their generation, whose more
expressive and aesthetic styles of rejecting American culture
dispose them to avoid what they take to be the sterile "hassles" of
intellectual confrontation.  There is also a vocal minority who, as
has been said, feel personally excluded when they hear an appeal to
reason.
