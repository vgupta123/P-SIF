chromosome changes in pplo-infected fl human amnion cells.
characteristic chromosome
changes were observed in pplo-infected fl
human amnion cells.  these changes included
a gradual reduction in chromosome numbers,
increase in chromosome aberrations, and the
appearance of 3 new varieties.  although some
of the aberrations appeared early after infec-
tion, most changes developed slowly, over a
period of several months.
