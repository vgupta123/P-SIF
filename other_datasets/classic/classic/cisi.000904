No Special Rules for Entry of Serials
   One of the objectives of a library catalog is to enable one to determine
what books or publications by an author are in the library.. Establishment
of special rules of entry for serial publications which preclude attribution of
authorship defeats this objective.. The present rule 6 of the Anglo_American
Cataloging Rules are the Paris Principles are criticized in this regard.. In the
course of this criticism, it is shown that the presence of a generic title, the
presence of the name of a corporate body within the serial publication are not
valid criteria for determining authorship of a serial publication.. Furthermore, 
using the form of publication produces unpredictable entries for serials..
Therefore, it is proposed that special rules for entry of serials be abolished,
that a serial be treated like any other work of corporate or personal authorship,
including compilations and works produced under editorial direction.. This will
have the added benefit of allowing consistent treatment of instances of 
corporate and personal authorship..
