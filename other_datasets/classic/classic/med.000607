speech therapy with selected patients with
congenital velopharyngeal inadequacy
this paper has described the clinical speech problems of three patients
without cleft palates but with velopharyngeal inadequacy.  pharyngeal
flap surgery was performed on each patient after speech therapy was
found to be ineffective following systematic trial.  therapy continued
following the surgery.  the youngest child, a first grader, realized normal
speech following the surgery and therapy.  the two other children continue
to have aberrant but improved speech.
