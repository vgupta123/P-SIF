Weighted Increment Linear Search for Scatter Tables
A new linear search for hash tables whose increment
step is a function of the key being addressed 
is presented.  Comparisons with known methods are given,
in terms of efficiency and computation complexity. 
 In particular, the new method applies to tables of
size n = 2^r.  It allows full table searching, and 
practically eliminates primary clustering at a very low cost.
