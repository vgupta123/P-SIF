The ML/I Macro Processor
A general purpose macro processor called ML/I
is described.  ML/I has been implemented on the 
PDP-7 and I.C.T. Atlas 2 computers and is intended as a
tool to allow users to extend any existing programming 
language by incorporating new statements and other
syntactic forms of their own choosing and in their 
own notation.  This allows a complete user-oriented
language to be built up with relative ease.
