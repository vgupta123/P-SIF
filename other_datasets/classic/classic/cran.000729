stresses in continuous skin stiffener panels under random loading .
theoretical aspects involved in the prediction of stress levels for
continuous skin-stiffener panels subjected to a random pressure field
are considered in the light of powell's general theory for statistical
superposition of modal response . the choice of structural model is
dictated by the prevalence of skin-stiffener construction in modern
flight vehicle design . the present study clearly demonstrates that any
truly adequate prediction of stress levels in actual aircraft structures
 requires a much better representation of structural characteristics
than can be provided by single panel idealizations . in an example
considering fuselage panels exposed to jet engine noise, essential
agreement is shown with experimental data, although better correlation is
shown for rms stress than for power spectrum . it is shown that
reduction of stress level by increasing damping is effective only in the
higher frequency range .
