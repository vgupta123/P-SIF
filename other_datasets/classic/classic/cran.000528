first-order slip effects on the laminar boundary layer over a slender
body of revolution with zero pressure gradient .
in reference 1, the analysis given by probstein and elliott for the
zero-pressure-gradient, constant-wall-temperature, compressible,
laminar boundary layer with transverse curvature was extended to
first-order slip flow .  this extension was based on a double asymptotic
expansion in a transverse-curvature parameter and a slip parameter .
the expansion in ref. 1, however, was carried out with the parameter
held constant .  for and a constant wall temperature, is constant and
e varies with x due to the dependence of the local body radius on x .
thus, for arbitrary body shapes, e will not be constant .  in the
present note, the analysis of ref. 1 is re-examined taking into account
the variation of e .
