Automation of the Radioisotope Accountability System
The Radioisotope Service of the Veterans Administration
Hospital, Omaha, Nebraska, used a manual 
system of radioisotope accountability for three years.  The
procedure which was satisfactory but time-consuming 
was converted from manual to a fully automated computer
system in January, 1963.  The program for purchased 
radioisotopes is written in FORMAT FORTRAN for the IBM
1620 Computer.  A second program for maintaining 
accountability for reactor-created radioisotopes is written
 in the FORCOM programming language.  A minimum 
amount of bookkeeping is required by the reactor operating
staff.  The United States Atomic Energy Commission 
regulations specify that records be kept.  This system
provides detailed records for each container of 
radioactive material purchased and/or created in the Triga
reactor indicating the amounts received, used, 
and/or transferred to the health physicist for disposal.
 Consolidated records contain total amounts 
received, used, and/or disposed of for any specified period
of time.  Purchased radioisotopes are reported 
in millicuries; reactor-created radioisotopes in microcuries.
