a study of childhood schizophrenia
and early infantile autism
(part i--description of the sample)
following a period of observation of
three months' duration, a group of twelve
autistic schizophrenic children were se-
lected for a treatment program.  the
group was selected on criteria which
would allow a reasonable chance of suc-
cessful treatment in a group homo-
geneous enough to allow statistical con-
siderations to be valid.
younger age, average intellectual func-
tioning, presence of an intact family in
or near to metropolitan toronto and a
firm diagnosis of autistic schizophrenia
were the limiting factors.
rather distinct differences were noted
in this treatment group as opposed to the
larger observation group.  the dis-
tinguishing characteristic was undoubted-
ly the speech abnormalities present.
