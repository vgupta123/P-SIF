On Declaring Arbitrarily Coded Alphabets
The inability of existing programming languages
to handle character strings from more than 
one or two alphabets is mentioned and a scheme for declaring
additional alphabets is proposed.  The scheme 
provides for: many-to-one encodings, right or left
justification, collating sequences different from 
numeric sequence, variations in character size (number
of bits.) from alphabet to alphabet, and arbitrary 
source-language character representation.
