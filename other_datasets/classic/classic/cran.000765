clamped short oval cylindrical shells under hydrostatic
pressure .
  the principle of the minimum of the total potential is
employed to obtain stresses and displacements for clamped, short,
oval cylindrical shells under hydrostatic pressure .  classical
shell theory, in which buckling effects are not considered, was
used .  a fourier series is assumed for the deflections in the
closed circumferential direction so that the partial differential
equations of equilibrium are replaced by a set of ordinary
differential equations .  the energy solution is compared with a
simplified approximation which can be considered an equivalent circular
cylinder solution .  graphs of the significant stresses and
displacements are presented for oval cylinders having major to minor
axis ratios of 1.10, 1.30, and 1.50 .  it is shown that the maximum
stresses and displacements increase significantly as the major to
minor axis ratio is increased .
