response of plates to a decaying and convecting randon
pressure field .
  following the methods of lyon, an analysis of the
vibratory response of a plate to a random pressure
field is given .  the pressure correlation of the random
field is assumed to have a scale small compared to
the plate size, to decay exponentially, and to convect
with constant speed over the plate .  two cases are
considered, one in which the convection speed is much
less than the speed of free flexural waves in the plate,
the other in which the convection speed is the same
order as the flexural wave speed .  the mean square plate
displacement is shown to be relatively independent
of convection for speeds much less than the flexural
wave speed, and to increase significantly for speeds in
the order of the flexural wave speed .  it is shown that
damping is usually, but not always, an effective means
of vibration reduction .  in the case of convection
speeds much smaller than the flexural speed, the use of
hysteretic damping for reduction of the displacement
response is shown to be limited by the decay of the
assumed random pressure field .
