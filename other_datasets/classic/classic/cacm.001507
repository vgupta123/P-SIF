A Multiprogramming Environment for Online Data Acquis ition and Analysis
An experimental system for acquis ition and analysis
of large bodies of data derived from scientific 
experiments is described.  Its architecture and implementation
is largely based on certain objectives 
and characteristics of a general data analysis scheme.
 Early applications have been oriented towards 
the investigation of data obtained in biological research.
 Some of the problems encountered by the chosen 
approach are discussed.
