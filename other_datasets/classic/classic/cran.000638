longitudinal aerodynamic characteristics at low subsonic
speeds of a highly swept wing utilizing nose deflection
for control .
  an investigation has been conducted
in the langley 7- by 10-foot transonic
tunnel at low subsonic speeds to determine
the longitudinal aerodynamic
characteristics associated with deflection of the
nose section of a highly swept delta
wing having an aspect ratio of 1.33 .  in order
to illustrate the effectiveness of
this forward control, the longitudinal control
characteristics are also presented
for the wing with upper-and lower-surface
split flaps located at the trailing
edge .
  comparison between the longitudinal
aerodynamic characteristics of the wing
utilizing the nose control and those of
the wing utilizing the upper-surface
split flap located at the trailing edge
indicated similar control effectiveness
for high control deflections (15) and
similar values of trimmed lift-drag ratio
with increasing lift coefficient .  use
of the nose control, however, indicated a
lower value of trimmed angle of attack
for a given value of trimmed lift
coefficient than that realized from use of
the upper-surface split flap .  further
reductions in trimmed angle of attack
for a given value of trimmed lift
coefficient may be realized from deflection
of the lower-surface split flap at the
wing trailing edge in combination with
the nose control and would be accompanied
by large reductions in lift-drag ratio .
