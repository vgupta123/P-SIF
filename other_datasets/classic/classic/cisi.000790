Computer Indexing of Medical Articles - Project Medico
   An automatic indexing method is described in which index tags for documents 
are generated by the computer.. The computer scans the text of periodical 
articles and automatically assigns to them index terms with their respective 
weights on the basis of explicitly defined text characteristics.. A machine 
file of document references with their associated index terms is automatically 
produced which can be searched on a co-ordinate basis for the retrieval of 
specified drug-related information..
