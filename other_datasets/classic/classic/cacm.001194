Establishment of the ACM Repository and Principles
of the IR System Applied to its Operation
The history of the establishment of the ACM Repository
at the Moore School, University of Pennsylvania, 
is reviewed briefly.  Two principles are presented as
paramount in the provision of information services: 
(1) easy accessibility to the information files by users
unfamiliar with file organization, and (2) value 
of service exceeding user costs.  These principles serve
as guides in mechanizing the ACM Repository. 
 The main features of the information system are direct
user access via on-line teletypewriter console, 
direct user access to all details of the system organization,
unrestricted and expandable search vocabulary, 
user access through many facets of document indexing,
and stochastic search through linked index terms 
and other file relationships.  The first contribution
to the ACM Repository consisted of 315 documents, 
relating primarily to early research on compilers.  These
documents have been cataloged and indexed and 
the catalog is scheduled to appear in Computing Reviews.
 The indexing system is described in detail. 
 The Main Catalog is used to describe the documents,
and inverted lists are provided by the Repository 
system for retrieval by concept coordination.
