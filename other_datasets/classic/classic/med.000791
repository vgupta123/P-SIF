sustained palliation in
ovarian carcinoma
management of 64 cases of advanced
ovarian carcinoma has been analyzed.
an attempt is made to compare the
value of radiation and the value of chloram-
bucil, using salvage time and sustained pal-
liation as end points.
chlorambucil, an outpatient oral medi-
cation, appears to be as efficacious as ra-
diation in advanced ovarian carcinoma.
chlorambucil may be used before or
after irradiation therapy.
pleural and peritoneal effusion respond
favorably to chlorambucil 80% of the time.
the possibility of using a different
dosage schedule is discussed.
