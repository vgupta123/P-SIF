ablation of glassy materials around blunt bodies of
revolution .
  the steady-state equations of motion for a
thin layer of an incompressible glassy material on the
surface of an ablating and radiating blunt
body are reduced to a first-order ordinary differential
equation which is integrated numerically .
this solution is coupled with the solution of the air
boundary layer for both laminar and turbulent
heat transfer with or without mass vaporization of
the ablating material .  the distribution of the
effective energy of ablation around the body is thus
obtained for a cone cylinder with a hemispherical
cap that re-enters the atmosphere at hypersonic
flight speeds, and has quartz as the ablating
material .  it is found that the ablation process from
turbulent heating is more efficient than from
the laminar case because of increased vaporization .
this solution of the equations of motion at the
stagnation point has been verified by are wind tunnel
experiments .  the present state of development
of the are wind tunnel does not permit its use for
experimental investigations of ablation around
blunt bodies under turbulent heating .
