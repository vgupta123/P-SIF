  axisymmetric viscous flow past unyawed very slender bodies
of revolution is treated within the category of the perfect gas .
attention is paid especially to the effect of transverse curvature
of the body .  from the transformed equations, the similarity
conditions are deduced, and the parameter characterizing the
effect of transverse curvature is obtained .  several numerical
solutions of similarity equations for hypersonic flows are
presented, and upon the basis of these results, the effect of the
transverse-curvature parameter is discussed .  a method of
applying the local-similarity approximation to obtain the
approximate solution for nonsimilar cases is described, as are
practical applications to incompressible flow past a long cylinder and
to hypersonic flow past a very slender cone .  comparison with
experimental results shows fair agreement with calculations using
the local-similarity approximation in the present range of
experimental flow conditions .
