pressure distribution on two dimensional wings near
the ground .
  a simple method of calculating
the pressure distribution in
incompressible flow on two-dimensional aerofoils
of arbitrary section at moderate
distances from the ground is developed .
comparisons with an /exact/ potential
flow solution, and with measurements
on a 10 thick aerofoil of rae.101
section, provide a satisfactory
verification of the adequacy of the method ,.
but it is shown that it is necessary
to take account of the boundary layer
on the aerofoil in the calculations .
