a process for the step-by-step integration of differential
equations in an automatic digital computing machine .
  it is advantageous in automatic
computers to employ methods of integration
which do not require preceding function values
to be known .  from a general theory given by
kutta, one such process is chosen giving
fourth-order accuracy and requiring the minimum
number of storage registers .  it is developed into
a form which gives the highest attainable
accuracy and can be carried out by comparatively
few instructions .  the errors are studied and
a simple example is given .
