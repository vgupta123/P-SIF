The Synthesis of Solids Bounded by Many Faces
A technique is presented which allows a class
of solid objects to be synthesized and stored 
using a computer.  Synthesis begins with primitive solids
like a cube, wedge, or cylinder.  Any solid 
can be moved, scaled, or rotated.  Solids may also be
added together or subtracted.  Two algorithms to 
perform addition are described.  For practical designers,
the technique has the advantage that operations 
are concise, readily composed, and are given in terms
of easily imagined solids.Quite short sequences 
of operations suffice to build up complex solids bounded by many faces.
