heat transfer to flat plate in high temperature rarefied
ultra-high mach number flow .
  an investigation was conducted in a hypersonic
shock tunnel to determine the local heat transfer
rates for a sharp leading edge flat plate .  the free
stream mach number range was 7.95 to 25.1 with
stagnation temperatures of approximately 2550
and 6500 r .  for these temperature and mach
number conditions, the strong interaction parameter,
varied from 2.35 to 826 .  the
corresponding knudsen numbers, based on the
ratio of the free stream mean free path and the
leading edge thickness, varied from 0.38 to 85.5 .
for free stream mach numbers greater than 10,
knudsen numbers of approximately unity, and
perfect gas conditions, the calculated heat transfer
coefficients were found to vary as as predicted
by the noninsulated flat plate theory of li
and nagamatsu .  for the case of,
the leading edge slip phenomenon
drastically reduced the local heat transfer coefficients
as compared to the theoretical values predicted
with no slip at the surface .  for the extreme case of and,
the measured local
heat transfer rate was an order of magnitude
less than the analytical value .  both the knudsen
number and the free stream mach number are
important physical parameters that determine the
extent of the slip-flow region .
