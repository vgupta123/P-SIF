on the numerical calculation of detached bow shock
waves in hypersonic flow .
  a method is described for calculating examples of hypersonic
flow with a detached bow shock wave past a bluff axially
symmetric body .  the form of the shock wave is assumed, and the
analysis is based on a cauchy problem for the stream function
in the subsonic region, where the motion is governed by a
partial differential equation of elliptic type .  through analytic
continuation into the complex domain, the cauchy problem is
reformulated in such a manner that it becomes properly set in the
subsonic region .  this leads to a stable scheme for computation
of the flow by finite differences .  numerical examples at
freestream mach number 5.8 are presented in which the flow is
determined throughout the subsonic region, and, in particular, the
detachment distance, the location of the sonic line, and the
pressure distribution along the body are calculated .  these results are
in excellent agreement with experimental data obtained at the
california institute of technology .
