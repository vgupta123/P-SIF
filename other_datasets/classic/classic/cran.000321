improved numerical solution of the blasius problem with three-point
boundary conditions .
the blasius equation describes the velocity distribution resulting from
laminar, constant-pressure mixing of a stationary fluid layer and a
moving stream . in connection with a numerical procedure for the univac
based on analytic continuation of the function f' . high-speed computers
 now make it feasible to use analytic continuation for numerical
integration of single-point boundary-value problems such that, within
the limits of taylor's expansion, truncation error may be made
arbitrarily small . a brief description of the application of the
routine is given .
